\section{The Sun}
The Sun is an extremely complex ball of plasma, th=e formation of which generated the collection of planets and asteroids we call the solar system.
As such, the study of our nearest star should be at the forefront of our research into the cosmos; any model we build to examine other stars must first accurately describe our star. 
The Sun takes its place on the Hertzsprung-Russell \cite{Hertzsprung} \cite{Russell1914} diagram as an early life main sequence star at the yellow end of the stellar spectrum.
It is a population 3 star, meaning that it has a high metallic content, a fact which aids in our observations immeasurably.

\subsection{Structure}
The sun is approximately $6.96 \times 10^{8}$ m in diameter and has an average density of $1.4$ gcm$^{-3}$, approximatley $40\%$ more than the density of water and constitutes $98\%$ of the mass within our solar system.

The structure of the Sun can be divided into internal and external.
Internal structure has been inferred by the use of techniques such as seismology, therefore we still have many questions as to the exact mechanisms dominating below the photosphere.
These examinations have revealed a stratified structure, and the centre of which is the fusion core.
Currently, the fusion process is converting $2$ Hydrogen atoms to $1$ Deuteron, positron and neutrino; this Deuteron then reacts with another proton to form ${^3}$He and a gamma particle, and lastly two $^{3}$He combine to form $^{4}$He and two protons, known as the proton-proton chain as demonstrated in \cite{Bethe1939}. 
However as the star evolves this process will change, because as one fuel source runs out, the previous product becomes the new fuel.
\emph{E.g.} the next phase would convert two Helium atoms to a Beryllium atom and a gamma particle.
The particles given off in the form of gamma particles and neutrinos carry away the excess energy, and go on to form the radiative zone.
These processes require extremely high pressure and temperature in order to overcome the binding energy of the atoms taking part in the process.
The conditions needed for this fusion process are generated by gravitational pressure exerted by the rest of the star which inherently increases the temperature in accordance with the ideal gas law, \citep{Larson2003}.

The radiative zone is appropriately named, in that, the excess energy generated in the core radiates through this section.
It has been calculated that a photon emitted in the core takes on average $100,000$ years to move through the radiative zone as a result of the random walk, a process by which a photon is emitted and absorbed repeatedly.

The tachocline is a thin layer between the radiative zone and the convection zone, of which not a great deal is known.
This is the point where p-mode oscillations, used in seismology, cease to penetrate further into the solar interior and is strongly suspected to have a crucial role in generating the solar magnetic field.
There have been recent studies, such as \cite{Obridko2007} which suggest that the tacholine is responsible for several $1.3$ to $3$ year cycles in feature observed higher in the solar atmosphere, however this has not been definitively proven.
It has also been proposed as the source for a dynamo generating the magnetic field.
The most important result of the tachocline is that at this point, the motion changes from uniform behaviour of the radiation zone to the differential rotation of the convective zone.
This differential rotation is the cause of much of the complexity inherent in the solar body.


Beyond the tachocline, radiative heat transport ceases to be as effective, and as such, convection becomes the primary form energy transport, thus, this region is named the convection zone. 
A result of this lower temperature is a transformation in the bulk motion and ao overall behaviour of the plasma.
Within the radiative zone the plasma is approximately $5$ MK and is consequently fully ionised, however with the decrease in temperature, comes a transition in the behaviour of the plasma, density drops, and the heavier elements are now not ionised.

The process by which convection takes place is cellular in nature, hot plasma rising and cool plasma falling back through the solar interior.
The condition which must be fulfilled by a fluid element in order to begin a convecting behaviour is named the Schwartzchild criteria.
This criteria describes the motion of a fluid element upon being perturbed by external forces, the element is then referred to as being stable or unstable against convection.
If the element is perturbed and the resulting buoyancy force causes movement upwards or downwards in accordance with the density of the feature \emph{i.e.} if it is less dense, causing motion upwards, or more dense causing the element to sink for a given constant pressure.

\end{figure}


The cellular nature onset is a result of the less dense fluid element rising until it becomes hotter than its surroundings and expands, leading to a cooling phase as is to be expected from the ideal gas laws.
The plasma then cools, and a perturbation from an external force will cause the plasma to fall back through the atmosphere; a result of it now being cool and therefore denser than is surroundings.
This can be expressed simply by stating that when the temperature gradient is greater than the adiabatic gradient, then the onset of convection can begin \cite{Hansen2004}.
Clearly, there will be a set of environmental factors which will lead to the above condition being fulfilled.
When the gas is completely ionised, the adiabatic gradient will be constant and convection, unimportant.
In order to completely ionise a gas an extremely high temperature must me attained, therefore let us consider the case for Hydrogen, the dominant element in nearly all stars.
At the temperature of $10,000$ K, Hydrogen will be totally ionised and convection will not occur, however less than this and an adiabatic gradient will become apparent.
The pressure gradient will also impact the onset of the convection, if the scale height is greater, the higher the fluid element will have to travel before it expands and cools.
In the Sun these conditions are fullfilled when the temperature drops to $9,000$ K, this is due to this being the real world and not all the atoms and molecules are Hydrogen.
As a result we get the transition from radiation zone to convection zone.

The photosphere is the layer of the Sun which we can observe with the naked eye.
The photosphere is so called, because this layer emits light in the visible spectrum, and has a temperature range of $6000$ K at the base, and $4700$ K at the top. 
From a distance, the photosphere appears to be a smooth sphere, however upon closer inspection we observe granulation, as a result of the convection zone, is ubiquitous throughout the layer.
Granulation appears as dark lines and bright 'bubbles' expanding and collapsing as hot material rises, cools and consequently falls back down into the solar interior.
These features tend to measure approximately $2$ Mm from one boundary to the other, which, are know as inter-granular lanes.
When granules bulk motion is observed , it becomes apparent that they group into larger, super-granules, where the overall motion of the granules radiates away from a central point until they fade at a point where they meet similar granules from another super-granule.
% need a granulation figure here

The most prominent feature in the photosphere are Sunspots, these are widely documented.
Observations of sunspots are dated as far back as Galileo and his first telescopes.
These features are significantly cooler that the surrounding photosphere, with a dark centre, known as the umbra, through which open magnetic field emerges from the solar interior.
Spreading away from the umbra is the penumbra, a ring of long thin structures spreading away from the umbra.
These have been widely studied and have become known as fibrils.
The reason these are so widely studied, is that it has become clear that waves travel up these features from the solar interior.
Sunspots are normally part of an extremely complex system of magnetic field, meaning that there are usually many in one active region.
It is not yet clear the exact mechanism by which sunspots are formed, however the favoured hypothesis is that of flux rope emergence.
In this model a 'rope' of magnetic field is forced up through the convection zone and the photosphere carrying plasma frozen into the magnetic field lines with them.
As a result of this formation mechanism, active regions have regions of both negative and positive polarity.
Particularly of note with sunspots, is their continual rotation.
They are observed to rotate in the opposite direction to the rotation of the Sun, while at the same time they migrate to the equator due to the magnetic configuration between the poles.


% Chromosphere
The first observations of the chromosphere were made during total solar eclipses.
When the moon entirely covered the solar disk \emph{i.e.} the photosphere, apparent at the solar limb were colourful streamers radiating from the solar centre.
The density drops sharply from the photosphere to the order of $10^{-4}$ and is approximately $2$ Mm thick. 
Over this $2$ Mm layer the temperature rises from $4000$ K to $25,000$ K, this result is currently one of the primary focuses of the solar research community.
The chromosphere is incredibly complex interms of its magnetic structure and the transport of heat, consequently the chromosphere plays and essential role in the formation of explosive events such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

It is in the chromosphere where we now see the magnetic fields which are rooted in the sunspots we observe in the photosphere.
These appear as large scale loops of plasma which has been locked into the magnetic field lines, extending through this region and right into the corona, they regularly reach 10's of Mm into the atmosphere.
Lower in the chromosphere, we find a second, smaller scale population of loops, and are a few Mm across on average.
Small scale chromospheric loops have been presented as a possible link between the photosphere and the chromosphere, due the their most likely formation being a small scale flux emergence event.
% more needs to be said here

Examining any image of the chromosphere, it is almost impossible to miss the fabled 'forest of spicules'.
Spicules are small, short-lived, explosive events with origins in the chromosphere which extend through the transition region and into the corona.
They are ubiquitous in the chromosphere, their number density being of the order of $10^5$ at any given time, however, their spatial distribution is not uniform.
They are found to form on intergranular lanes, as such their is much debate about how they form.
Candidates for the formation mechanism are; magnetic reconnection, p-mode driven and 'plasma drains', although there is no conclusive evidence for any of these drives.
Spicules high number density has lead many to propose them as a possible solution to the coronal heating problem, be that through instability or propagation of waves into the atmosphere directly.
Recent in depth study has revealed the possibility of two populations of spicules, dubbed, Type-I and Type-II.
Type-I have been defined to be longer lived and less explosive, they are also observed to emerge and have a ballistic motion away from and returning to the Sun.
However, Type-II show significantly more explosive velocities, up to $150$ km/s recorded during their initial formation, however, they are not observed to return and lifetimes are not expected to exceed $5$ mins. 

Particularly noticeable in the chromosphere is the appearance of coronal holes.
These appear as regions of dark amongst the bright chromospheric features, this is a result of the cool plasma, lower in the atmosphere becoming visible through these holes.
During the minimum phase of the solar cycle, there are usually two prominent coronal holes at the solar poles. 
These can cover half of the solar disk during particularly inactive solar minima, however, at solar maxima, these polar coronal holes disappear as the magnetic field becomes increasingly complex.
The coronal holes are characterised by open magnetic field lines extending up though the solar atmosphere, whereas, in the quiet Sun (areas not coronal holes) the magnetic field lines are closed, generally forming small and large scale loops.

This magnetic field configuration of open field lines at the poles and profound non-uniformity between is a result of the differential rotation above the tachocline.
Due to faster angular velocities at the equator than at the poles, magnetic field lines which would be straight, pole to pole, are warped in accordance with the frozen in condition.
Eventually, the magnetic field between $60^\circ$ and $-60^\circ$ forms into approximate bands of alternating opposing polarity magnetic field.
The mechanism by which this structure forms, results in converging bands, \emph{i.e.} a sideways 'V' symmetrical around the equator.
This can act as a guide for other solar features, such as sunspots, pushing them towards the solar equator from either side.

A demonstration of this complex magnetic field, is the magnetic bright point.
Theses are prevelent throughout the solar atmosphere, we observe them in the photosphere and corona, however, they are very prevalent in the chromosphere.
They are thought to be regions of very high magnetic pressure, causing higher gas pressure and therefore an increase in temperature.

% not finished with the chromosphere yet 

There are several large scale features with their roots in the chromosphere.
Filaments, and their off limb counterparts prominences, are very prevalent in solar imaging.
Filaments are observed as dark strands of plasma, having risen from the cool photosphere against the hotter chromosphere, that can extend far across the solar disk and have lifetimes of many months.
Prominences are the same features observed over the limb, and hence appear as bright features against the dark sky.
This allows us to observe the impact on the atmosphere more closely. 
Upon inspection, we observe the plasma falling away from the main body of the prominence, becoming known as coronal rain.
The effect this rain has on the atmosphere is not yet fully understood, but there has be disussion as to its merits in terms of possible heating or cooling effects.

At the top of the chromosphere, temperature of the plasma increases rapidly over a very short distance, approximately $500$ km, this is known at the transition region.
It acts as a barrier, and amplifier, between chromosphere and corona with the temperature rising from $25,000$ K to $2$ MK, the mechanism which causes this is still not understood and is one of the prominent problems in solar physics.

%Corona
Above the transition region we find the corona, high temperature plasma whose behaviour is now dominated by the magnetic field which has emerged from the solar interior.
It is very rich in Iron , which, we can tell is ionised from observations, and such the temperature has a minimum value of $1 \times 10^6$ K.
The corona is a very complex system where features interact strongly with each other.
Here we observe very large scale structures here such as coronal loops and streamers, as well as transient explosive events such as Solar Flares and CME's, regularly in the same event.
Streamers are self descriptive flows of plasma moving radially away from the solar disk, they are particularly prevalent above the coronal holes and over magnetic features, such as loops, the resulting plasma from streamers then go on to contribute to the solar wind.
Coronal loops, CME's and solar flares are tightly related.
As the footpoints of the coronal loops, Sunspots, rotate and migrate towards the equator, the magnetic tension of the loop increases to the point at which a reconnection event is the only way of reducing the magnetic energy in the system.
This mechanism for the formation of solar flares is known as 
The material in the overlying loops becomes unbound as a result of the release of magnetic tension, and is released in the form of a CME, although this is not always the case.

The above model applies more to solar flares which are observed low in the corona and chromosphere, there is a seperate model in which the reconnection occurs much higher in the corona.
There is a standard model for the formation of solar flares.
The models' initial condition involves an arcade of coronal loops, with open magnetic field lines forming a streamer around the outside.
At the top of the coronal loop, a region of cool, dense plasma forms, however, remains suspended by the magnetic field.
Eventually the system will reach a non-equilibrium state and the filament will be ejected outwards from the loop system.
The resulting elongation of the magnetic field, eventually leads to the field lines, previously on opposite sides of the loop, becoming close enough that magnetic force brings them together.
This effectively severs the anchor holding the plasma filament in place, releasing it into the high corona and solar wind. 
This release of energy also has the effect of accelerating particles down the underlying coronal arcade, causing heating and brightening.
The nature of these events is sufficient to cause 'bursts' in the electromagnetic spectrum.
This is the phenomena that has been named the solar flare, which are categorised on a scale by class, B, C, M and X, with X being the highest energy (Wm$^{-2}$) and B being the lowest and 9 subdivisions within each class. 

The remaining ejected material then either falls back to the solar surface or carries on to form a coronal mass ejection.
These are very large scale features in the corona, both spatially and temporally.
They propagate through the corona, into the solar wind and beyond Earth.
They are categorised (in the LASCO database) based upon the appearance, Halo, partial halo and complete.
This is based on the difference with respect to the Earth/viewing position, a CME which is directed at Earth will appear as a halo around the Sun.
Viewed from the side, we see the fine structure of the CME, prevalent is the leading edge, at the fore of the propagating feature beneath which is a void.
The centre of the CME is generally the core, comprising of the filament that has just detached from the solar surface.
They are inherently imbued with the magnetic field that originated in the solar atmosphere.
As this magnetic field propagates through the solar wind, a shock is thought to form at the bow of the feature, these shocks may also excite heavy ions in the solar wind causing turbulence and heating.

The when the coronal materials bulk motion becomes radial, it is defined to be the solar wind.
At this point the plasmsa is dominated by the magnetic field and may be considered collisionless \emph{i.e.} he distance between the ions is greater than the mean free path.
Due to the parker spiral, the magnetic field is perpendicular to the bulk velocity of the plasma, he solar wind is not, however, uniform.
The structure is divided into two mode, fast and slow solar wind. 
The difference between the two mode was highlighted by the readinds taken by the Ulessyes mission, while in a slingshot polar orbit around Jupiter and the Sun.
The SWOOPS instument on-board, measured the velocities of ions in the solar wind and found that the distribution is non uniform.
Above the poles, the plasma reaches velocities up to $800$ km s${^[]-1]}$ whereas, around the quiet Sun regions we find a lower range, $300$ - $400$ km s${^[]-1]}$.

With such an energetic feature extending far into the solar system, how this interacts with the planets of the utmost importance.
Planets such as Mercury and Mars with little or no magnetic field to speak of, are bombarded by the energetic particles in the solar wind.
This is also the case for the moon, with small local magnetic fields (no global dynamo) it is directly exposed.
The moon provides the best opportunity to examine such a system, we therefore observe multiple different ways the solar wind interacts with it.
% citation of that lunar paper needed here
Primary among them is proton back scattering off the lunar surface as energetic neutral atoms, roughly $8$ - $28\%$ of the particles scattered are Hydrogen.
Conversely, we also observe sputtering, however He$^{++}$ atoms are much better sputtering agents than H$^{+}$, so were we to mine the lunar surface, we might find significant resources of this element. 
As such the Suns relationship with these, generally, rockier, less well 'protected' planets and solar system bodies is always going to result in direct contact between the solar surface and the surface.

The alternative is clearly planetary bodies which produce a global magnetic field.
In the case of the Earth, the magnetic field dynamo is the convecting cells of the molten magma core, whereas, in the case of the gas giants, the extremely high density causes the hydrogen to be in a metallic form and convecting cells of hydrogen are believed to be the initiator of Jupiters magnetic field.

In this case we observe and extremely complex structure and system.
The solar wind approaches with the magnetic field perpendicular to the orbital plane and the Earths' magnetic field in an approximate dipole state.
Therefore, we have a case where two vertical magnetic fields meet.
This leads to an increase in the magnetic field strength, Ion density and potential, this feature is known as the bow shock.
All the elements of the solar wind that interact with the bow shock will be affected in some way.
Ions and particles backstream off the bow shock, reflected by the potential barrier formed by the increase in magnetic field strength, and the solar wind magnetic field wraps around that of the Earth.
Behind the bow shock we find the magneto sheath, a magnetically turbulent region comprising the 
material that has managed to pass through the bow shock.
The density of particles and the magnetic pressure decreases over the magnetosheath until the pressure from this region is balanced by the Earths magnetic pressure, whereby, the magnetopause is formed.

Given that this region of the Earths magnetosphere is heavily influenced by the solar wind, the exact structure of it is defined by the state of the solar wind.
As such, the fast solar wind will compress this region further as the magnetic pressure will be higher and events such as CME's which increase the particle density, also altering this region significantly.

As the solar wind magnetic field wraps around this region, it will eventually come into contact with the open magnetic field lines at the Earths poles.
This leads to a reconnection event, releasing the magnetic tension in the open fields lines and causing them to be dragged out behind the Earth, forming the magneto tail, and eventually reconnecting with magnetic field which has made the same journey on the opposite side of the Earth. 
This forms a current sheet roughly in the equatorial plane, however, this will be impacted and changed by the solar wind and geomagnetic events in the same way as the magnetosheath.

A second result of the open magnetic field lines at the Earths poles, is that particles from the solar wind may interact with, and consequently spiral down these open magnetic field lines.
Particles spiralling down a magnetic field line are accelerating and, therefore, have excess energy which is dissipated as a electromagnetic radiation.
This manifests as the phenomenon known as the Aurora, observed at high magnitude latitudes, appearing as a ring of light when viewed from space.
Hence, when the earth is bombarded by geomagnetic storms created by flaring and CME type events, we see warping of the bowshock/magnetopause system and increased appearance of Aurora over a wider range of latitudes.

The question becomes, is the magnetospheric model we observe at Earth, applicable to the gas giants?
The answer appears to be yes, firstly, we observe Aurora on the poles of both Jupiter and Saturn, strongly implying a similar dipole magnetospheric structure with open field lines over the poles.
Differentiating the two systems is the massive size of Jupiter's magnetic field, $20,000$ times larger than that of Earths and extending 100 times further.
This significantly larger extent is, in part, due to the reduced pressure from the solar wind, allowing the magnetosphere to expand more significantly, but also attributed to the more powerful dynamo (sufficiently strong, that the Van Allen belts that are toroidal at Earth are flattened out by Jupiters magnetic field).

The Suns influence ends with the termination shock.
At this point the outward solar wind pressure is finally in balance with the pressure of the interstellar medium.
The result is that the solar wind suddenly decelerates, causing a shock to form, it has been proposed recently that voyager 2 has made it across this boundary becoming the first man made object to leave the solar system.
The region between the solar system and the inter stellar medium, draws parallels with that between the solar wind and our magnetosphere.
There is a bow shock due to the Suns progress around the galactic disk, a heliosheath and heliopause, all of which have proxies in the Sun-Earth interaction.

For all of these reasons, it is clear that the study of the Sun, its local environment and the explosive events are essential to our continued existence.
Geomagnetic storms have previously knocked out power lines and will affect the operations of satellites in orbit, consequently, predicting and understanding these explosive events is essential.

\subsection{Observations}

\subsubsection{History}
Mankind has been fascinated with the Sun for as long as we have been sentient, which is understandable given that it dictated seasons, whether crops grew and was a giant burning orb in the sky.
As such, in early civilisations it was regularly worshipped as a god.
Early Mesopotamian cultures worshipped Shamash, Rah was the Sun god of the Egyptians and Amaterasu is the Shinto godess.
Around these gods, mythologies were built; the Egyptian solar chariot, carrying the Sun across the sky, battled demons overnight to rise again on the other side; in Hinduism, the Sun god is named Surya and is driven across the sky in a seven-horsed chariot representing the days of the week.
These mythos speak to the inherent importance of the Sun to civilisation on Earth, however it was not until the $17^{th}$ century that scientific observations really begin to occur seriously.


Fresh advancements in glasswork and lens technology allowed the development of telescopes and camera obsucra.
Utilising the telescope to project the image (as not to look directly at the Sun) observers hand-drew their direct observations of the solar surface.
This was clearly the photosphere, due to its emissions being in the visible spectrum. 
The most prominent feature of the photosphere are the sunspots appearing at the surface; therefore, the early telescopes allowed significant study of this feature.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Chapter1/Figs/galileosunspot}
	\caption{Galileo's catalogue of hand drawn images of the solar photosphere, is one of the best examples of early solar observations. 
			Something we take for granted in modern solar observational techniques, is that we now have routines to correct the solar orientation.
			Due to the nature of the observations, Galileo and his contemporaries' records, the drawing will always demonstrate the 'angle' resultant of their observing position.}
	\label{fig:gali_sp}
\end{figure}

The work of Johannes Kepler demonstrated that the Sun rotated on its axis and sunspots were first observed by Harriot and the Fabricus family using a camera obscura. 
Initially there was debate as to what these dark features were - one hypothesis was that these were shadows of planetary bodies inside Mercurys orbit, but however Galileo demonstrated that their origin must lie on the surface.

Given the formative solar observation technology, this is where solar studies stayed for a very long time, a fact not aided by the period now termed the Maunder minimum (named for English astronomer Edward Maunder who presented this hypothesis).
This period lasted between 1675 and 1715, during which time the sunspot count almost entirely diminished.
During this minimum, the Earth's climate went in to what has become to be known as a 'Little Ice Age', where global temperatures lowered to a point where rivers, that were usually clear of ice, would freeze over to the point they could be reliably walked upon. % May be worth clarifying that this was only during the winter, not all year round :P

Study of the Sun took a large step forward when observatories such as the Royal Greenwich Observatory began taking meaurements in 1874.
Now with consistent imaging from the same source and a history of smaller observations combined, larger patterns within sunspots was revealed.
Taking a monthly average of the sunspot count revealed a rise and fall in the sunspot number count over an $11$ period, now referred to as the solar $11$-year cycle.
Sunspot numbers in modern times are calculated by the number of sunspot groups multiplied by $10$ as that is the average number of sunspots in a sunspot group.
This definition is utilised by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in America and Solar Influences Data Analysis Centre in Belgium (SIDC) in Belgium.
Both of these organisations monitor the Sun and its impact on Earth including radio flux and total solar irradiance.
All of these can be used as a proxy to demonstrate the $11$-year solar cycle.

If we plot the date of the sunspots occurrence with respect to their latitude, we produce another diagram demonstrating the $11$-year cycle.
This is the now famous butterfly diagram \ref{fig:sunspot_count}, in which populations of sunspots tend to form closer and closer to the equator before a break point at which they begin forming further away, the time scale of which is $11$ years.

This is a result of the previously discussed differential rotation mechanism in action in the Sun's motion.
As the magnetic field becomes increasingly complex and the bands of magnetic polarity grow closer, increasingly more sunspots are pushed to the solar equator.
This demonstrates that the $11$-year cycle is result of the magnetic field and dynamo.
However this is not the full picture.
As a result of the ever increasing complexity of the magnetic field the poles eventually flip.
It is at this point that the butterfly diagram moves from a narrow range of latitudes to a significantly wider one, therefore, the $11$-year cycle is actually two halves of a $22$-year cycle in which the magnetic field flips and then returns to its initial configuration.

\subsubsection{Spectroscopy}

Newton was the first to observe that light from the Sun could be divided into its component parts using a simple prism, but it was a very long time before we would reach a point where this information could be used for science.
In 1802, approximately 100 years after Newton's initial observation, William Wollaston observed the dark lines in the solar spectrum.
His results were published in a paper in which he tested the limits of compound refraction when prisms are used with water, sulphuric acid, crystalline lens of an ox, human cuticle, beeswax (from an island where there were no bees, however when compared to beeswax, was similar) and other such everyday substances.
He let a beam of sunlight enter a dark room and become incident upon a prism of flint glass.
He records that he observes two dark lines in green and blue, which, he notes 'in an imperfect experiment, might be mistaken for the boundary of these colours'.

Joseph von Fraunhofer investigated these lines even further using multiple prisms, enabling him to produce much higher refractive indices. 
He proceeded to measure and document all of the dark lines he could find, over 570, and designated the stronger lines A-K and weaker lines the rest of the alphabet.
Of course, due to the limitations of technology at the time, these lines are all in the visible spectrum and hence the wavelength range of $~300 - 900$ nm.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}


These lines are dark because they are absorption lines.
They are a result of the quantum mechanical effects of the electron energy shells around atoms and molecules.
In the case of the Sun, a continuous spectrum is radiated from the photosphere and this light then interacts with the elements higher up in the atmosphere.
Upon collision with an atom or molecule, the exact wavelength of light which corresponds to the energy required to excite an electron from one energy level to another is absorbed by that electron.
The direct result of this is that the wavelength absorbed in the energy transaction is absent from the white-light spectrum being emitted from the photosphere, and hence appears as a dark line when observed from beyond the solar atmosphere. 

The field progressed and we began to fully understand the elements and electron transitions responsible for these abortion lines.
One of the most famous examples of these is the Balmer series, named for the man himself, Johann Balmer.
This series is a set of 4 transitions to or from energy level $n = 2$, as can be seen in \ref{fig:balmer}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Chapter1/Figs/Balmer_series}
	\caption{\url{http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/B/Balmer_series.html}}
	\label{fig:balmer}
\end{figure}

The transition from $n=3$ to $n=2$ is termed Hydrogen alpha (H$\alpha$), $n=4$ to $n=2$, Hyrdogen beta and so on for $n=5$ and $n=6$, gamma and delta respectively. 
However, while the concept of a simple $1$-$1$, such as the above transition is clear, this does not always bear out in reality.
There can be environmental effects, such as temperature or magnetic field affecting the states of the energy level, which can cause alteration of the wavelength of light emitted from the decay of the electron.
For instance, Hydrogen alpha is extremely useful for solar observations due to the high abundance of the atom in the atmosphere.
However, due to external factors influencing the energy levels, when we observe Hydrogen alpha, the deviation from the theoretical transition is sufficient to broaden the line to include both the upper photosphere and lower chromosphere.
Of course, Hydrogen does not just have transitions to the $n=2$, there are series associated with; $n=1$, Lyman, $n=3$, Paschen, Brackett details transitions to $n=4$ and Pfunf, $n=5$.

Clearly this methodology can be applied to all atoms and molecules that are in the solar atmosphere, allowing us to create a larger picture of the structure of the atmosphere.
We can do this by abundance and position, \emph{i.e.} there appears to be large amounts of a given transition line emission in this region and forming a structure by inspection of an image taken using an approriate filter.
As has already been said, we can associate certain transitions with specific places of the solar atmosphere.
H$\alpha$ has already been discussed.
Moving up the atmosphere, we see He II $30.4$ \cite{Bazin2010} which is a Balmer-$\alpha$ transition, so $n=3$ to $n=2$, and has the same issue as H$\alpha$, in that it is extremely broad.
Calcium II and silicon IV are both emitted in the transition region and are observed by the most recent (at the time of writing) space-borne solar telescope, IRIS \cite{PereiraIRIS2014}.
They are closely associated with the thin transition region, but we do also observe separate features not exclusively within the transition region.

Above the transition region iron is bounteous, and so we have many emissions lines with which to examine the corona due to the high number of available transitions.
Fe VIII ($13.1$ nm), Fe IX ($17.1$ nm), Fe XII ($19.3$ nm), Fe XIV ($21.1$ nm), Fe XVI ($33.5$ nm) and Fe XVIII ($9.4$ nm) are all observed by the spacecraft Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) \cite{Schmelz2013}.
As the temperature of the atmosphere increases, the amount of available energy changes and different transitions are excited.
The various lines here therefore apply to different temperatures.



% magnetic field recording
The emission lines produced can also be affected by the environmental magnetic field, and as such we can find more out about the state of the plasma via spectroscopy.
The effect which allows us to do this is known as the Zeeman effect, whereby the magnetic field causes the energy levels to split based upon the spin of an electron, up or down.
This results in a splitting of what would be a single peak, into two, with the separation of the peak dependent of the size of the magnetic field present.
Finally, the peak that is produced is very weak, consequently, this is an unsuitable method in applications the chromosphere and upwards.

\end{figure}

A more suitable method by which we analyse the solar magnetic field is Stokes Polarisation Parameters, which describe the degree to which passing through a magnetic field has affected the electromagnetic radiation.
With this method, the total intensity of an optical beam is defined to be a sum of three forms of polarisation.
These three polarisations and the total are refereed to as the polarisation parameters, I, Q, U and V.
I is raw intensity of the electromagnetic radiation, Q is the linear polarisation horizontally and vertically, U is also linearly polarized however is rotated $\pm45^\circ$ from Q and lastly V, which is polarised circularly, both left and right handed.
Using a combination of the 4 intensities it is possible to construct a vectorgram of the magnetic field.
This is the method used by the SDO instrument Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) to examine features on disk.
These magnetograms are ineffective at the limb, which is a limitation of the method.
This is because a feature at the limb has no background light source to use as an origin to test the result of any polarisation. 

The vector magnetograms are used widely when studying active regions, due to the very high magnetic field strength.
They can track magnetic flux cancellation which regularly leads to the formation of other features, such as solar flares and CMEs, due to the release of magnetic energy into the corona \cite{Welsch2006}.

We also observe the small magnetic bright points, which we have mentioned are observed in the photosphere and chromosphere \cite{SanchesAlmeida2010}.
They are an inherent part of what is known as the magnetic network which was visible in original measurements of the solar magnetic field over the boundaries of supergranular cells.
The magnetic field emerges from the supergranule boundaries as open magnetic field lines, extending up, into the chromosphere and above \citep{Hasan2005}.
Of course, the structure therefore takes roughly the same form as the photospheric observations in G-Band (a Fraunhofer emission line; $43.079$ nm), but with bright structures highlighting the supergranular lanes \ref{fig:mag_network}.
As a result, we have open magnetic field lines emerging with a canopy of closed magnetic field between the two boundaries.
A structure such as this can be a catalyst for physical processes such as reconnection.

It is within these regions that the magnetic bright points reside.
They appear as points of extreme intensities against the cool dark plasma of the interganular lanes, due to their intense $0.1$ T magnetic field strengths.
They are demonstrated to drift and move as the granules evolve \citep{Chitta2012} which has led the community to suggest that these points could diffuse large amounts of heat into the solar atmosphere.

\subsubsection{Coronagraphs}

Beyond $5 R_\circ$, the solar wind has become collisionless, leading to minimal emissions as a result of the vastly decreased density.
Given this, we now change our approach to measure structures much further out in the corona and solar wind.
Currently, the only coronagraph still in operation is on-board the Solar Heliophysics Observatory (SoHO), the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO). 
It is a white light detector which makes use of the effect known as Thompson Scattering which allows us to observe the particles which aren't directly emitting light off limb.
The effect entails a photon colliding with a particle, and colliding with a free charged particle in a classical sense, as opposed to a quantum interaction.
As a result of this interaction, the original photon remains unchanged in terms of energy and frequency, by this method, light from the Sun is scattered off the particles in the corona and it is this light that the coronograph detects.
In order to ensure that the detector is not washed out by the light from the Sun, an occulting disc is essential to an operational coronagraph.


\subsection{Technology}

In the current solar observation climate, we have a wealth of information, coming from many different sources.
Understanding the functionality of these instruments in terms of the raw method is essential to rigorous science and accurate readings.

\subsubsection{Charge Coupled Devices (CCD's)}

CCDs are essential to current observational techniques and are utilised by almost every single solar mission.
They are an evolution of early photoelectric devices, which utilised the photoelectric effect, by which a photon is incident upon a surface and an electron is released.
Cumulative photons exiting more electrons eventually produce a current sufficiently large to be detected.
The were known as photomultiplier devices, the drawback of which was that the restriction to a single detection per focal plane (pixel).
The primary issue with these dectectors is that they are extemely sensitive to background radiation, some of which is a result of the thermal emission from the detector.
Environmental effects can cause the internal temperature of the detector to be non uniform - as such the level of background can differ significantly too.
Of course, all of these effects can be corrected for.
However, this will always increase the error value on the final result.

CCDs have since taken over the role which photomultipliers occupied.
Instead, CCDs are comprised of individual detectors all of high quantum efficiency arranged in a large grid, each element of which is a single pixel.
An individual pixel keeps an electronic record of the photons striking it (summing them to an intensity).
Each pixel behaves as a potential well, trapping electrons produced as a result of the photoelectric events with the incoming photons.
The charge resulting from the build up of electrons within the well will eventually reach a point at which it exceeds said well.
The resultant discharge of the capacitior is passed to the next in the row until it reaches the end of the row, at which point a charge amplifier is used to record a voltage for the row, eventually building up an image.

The particular advantage to a CCD is the one-to-one response to the incoming photons, giving extremely accurate results.
With respect to background noise and errors, the CCD is much easier to take regular dark current measurements (taking a reading with zero light coming in) and pixel-to-pixel variation is accounted for using flat-fielding (exposing the grid to uniform field).
The gird of pixels approach also allows for much are flexibility in analysing data and correcting for the effects of events such as cosmic rays.
This is possible due to the ability to read these recordings into a computer.

\subsubsection{Ground Based telescopes}

Solar physics spent its early development being applied in ground based solar telescopes, as has already been discussed, particularly in centres such as Royal Greenwich Observatory and Meudon Observatory in Paris.
In the modern era, the most powerful instruments, delivering high cadence and spatial resolution, are based on the ground.
Due to the challenges of observing on the ground, the location of these facilities is carefully chosen, regularly at high altitude, minimising disturbance of the signal by the atmosphere, and away from busy, polluting cities for the same reason.
The main advantages of ground based telescopes over space bourne, is that the instruments can be heavier and literally more extensive given that they do not need to be transported into space.

On La Palma in the canary islands, at $2360$ m altitude, the Swedish Solar Telescope is situated.
It utilises a $1.0$ m mirror in a refracting, vacuum solar telescope.
The vacuum is necessary due to the quantity of light the mirror reflects, causing heating which would disrupt the signal being transmitted down to the receiver.
The 'receiver' is what has become known as the optical bench; here the light beam is sent to one of several possible processing suites which are easily accessible to structure observations as needed.

SST has two such pipelines, one for the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum and another examining the blue end.
CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter (CRISP), focuses on the red end of the visible spectrum, whereas the soon to be updated instrument, Chromis, analyses the blue end.
The beam is split upon its arrival at the optical bench and sent to either of these instruments, but before the beam reaches CRISP there is a layer of correction known as adaptive optics.

Adaptive optics corrects for atmospheric scintillation, aberration and stabilises image motion.
These cumulative effects result in an optical path difference of the light incident with the lens/mirror of the telescope.
Given this information, it is crucial to know the atmospheric physics overlying and surrounding the telescope.
It is for this reason that observatories such as the Big Bear Solar Observatory \citep{Cao2010} in Los Angeles and the proposed new Chinese Giant Solar Telescopes \citep{Liu2014} are built on and by lakes, since the temperature will be lower, thus reducing heat haze, and therefore atmospheric effects.
The primary atmospheric parameters influencing the setup of the adaptive optics are the Fried parameter (which measures the quality of optical transmission), the Greenwood frequency (the bandwidth required for optimal correction) and the atmospheric turbulence profile (which allows a calculation of the refractive index of the atmosphere) as shown in \cite{Rimmele2011}.

As a result of the above points, the images from the SST are extremely customisable.
They are usually returned as data cubes, the dimensions of which are time, wavelength, x and y.
The resolution of these features are therefore changable dependant on the requirements of the observation.
Cadence can be as low as $2.5$ s, the spectral increment, $0.02$ nm, and spatial resolution of $0.12$ arcsec.
A part of what makes this form of observation viable is the ability to directly download the received signal, which is a limitation of space borne instrumentation.
Given the possibilities of ground based observations, the method is popular, with the aforementioned Big Bear Observatory joined by a plethora of other facilities, Richard B. Dunne solar telescope (DST) in New Mexico, Mauna Loa Solar Observatory on Hawii, which will shortly be joined by the Daniel K. Inouye Solar telescope (DKIST).
DKIST promises to be the most powerful telescope ever created with a $4$ m mirror, enabling resolution of $10$ km per pixel and overcoming the quantity of photons issues at the limb for spectropolarimetry.



\subsubsection{Space Based telescopes}

Space bourne telescopes have a significant advantage over their ground based counterparts due to the nearly constant un-interrupted, view of the Sun without the atmospheric effects disturbing the signal.
As a result, the volume of space based instrumentation has grown exponentially since the early Skylab missions taking solar images from a low Earth orbit.

The first solar mission to move on from imagers on space stations was the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO).
Placed at the gravitationally stable Lagrange point, L1, between the Sun and Earth, it affords constant viewing of the Sun.
It was one of the first missions to comprehensively cover the entire solar environment, the instruments of which are described in \cite{StCyr}.
The science covers dopplergrams of the photosphere, EUV imaging of the chromosphere and out to LASCO, monitoring the solar wind.

Following SoHO, the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) \citep{Garrard1997} was placed near the L1 point as well.
It was launched in $1997$ with a much more specific goal of anaylsing the contents of the solar wind, extremely pertinent as the constituents and energy inherent in the solar wind can have extensive effects at Earth.
As a result of this, the scientific mission of ACE is heavily leant towards instrumentation which physically measures the energy and identity of a given particle.
The Solar Wind Ion Mass Spectrometer (SWICS) and Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) are used to measure these properties.
SWICS was initially built for the ULYSSES \cite{Ulysses1992} mission which orbited the Sun in a novel slingshot orbit around Jupiter, normal to the plane of orbit.

SWICS utilises a mechanical collimator to collect and direct the particles to an electrostatic deflecton array, whereupon the incoming ions are deflected by the Lorentz force, $F_L = q(v \times B)$.
Clearly therefore, particles incoming with higher velocities, or greater charge, will generate a larger Lorentz force, and therefore demonstrate a greater deflection when detected.
The detection is managed by a solid state detector, a semiconductor, which works in a similar way to CCDs.
When the particle interacts with the semiconductor, a 'charge carrier' is released.
This charge carrier is an electron currently residing in the valence band of the semiconductor, which, as a result of the particle interaction, is exited into the conduction band.
This leaves a 'hole' in the valence band, paired with the exited electron. 
The pair then migrates to opposite electrodes at either end of the semiconductor as a result of a background electric field, whereupon they instigate a pulse which can be measured.
The amount of energy required to produce a given electron-hole pair is known and so the particles can be inferred.

The results this instrument produced one of the most iconic sets of readings in the modern era of solar physics.
As Ulysses completed its orbit, the radial velocity profile of the solar wind was found to vary over solar latitude.
At lower latitutes, the solar wind was found to be of the order $200$-$400$ km s$^{-1}$, before getting to higher latitudes and a distinct transition to much higher velocities.
At the time of this first orbit, the Sun was at a solar minimum, consequently there were clear and distinct coronal holes and quiet Sun, matching with the fast and slow wind respectively.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Chapter1/Figs/ulysses_solar_wind}
	\caption{\cite{McComas2003}}
	\label{fig:ulysses_sw}
\end{figure}

The confirmation of this association between wind mode and magnetic environment came in the next orbit of Ulysses.
In this orbit, the Sun was at maximum, therefore, was almost entirely constituted of quiet Sun magnetic environments.
During this orbit, the solar wind was found to be uniformly chaotic.
Velocities were found to climb as high as those found in a fast solar wind mode, however it is not the uniformly distributed fast mode emitted from the coronal holes, as evident in the solar minima readings.

Given that we now know that the solar wind and corona have significant reach and influence, a new mission was designed and initiated, the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) \cite{Gaeng1998}.
As the name suggests, this instrument was designed with the specific intention of investigating the higher reaches of the solar atmosphere.
Specifically, the aim of the mission was to investigate the three-dimensional structure of the low plasma beta atmosphere.
TRACE is a uniquely designed telescope, following the popular Cassegrain design, in which the primary mirror is divided up into 4 quadrants with separate coatings in order to filter the incoming light.
This method allows simple and efficient image co-aligning.
Given that TRACE was to observe the high atmosphere, Extreme Ultra Violet lines (with the rest of the EM spectrum filtered at entrance to the detector) were selected for the imaging instruments, Fe IX $17.1$ nm, Fe XII $19.5$ nm and Fe XV $28.4$ nm.




The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency have organised several solar missions.
Solar-A, renamed Yohkoh, \cite{Tsuneta1991} upon its successful launch and commencement of observations, pre-dates SoHO.
It covered soft and hard X-Ray ranges and spectrometers covering, specifically, the coronal iron lines and a wide band spectrometer. 
Yohkoh was particularly successful with respect to the detection of high energy events producing large amounts of energy and X-ray emission, such as coronal jets and solar flares.
Building on the success of Yohkoh, a new mission was planned, sequentially named Solar-B.
It was later renamed Hinode, Sunrise in English, upon its successful launch and is presented in \cite{Kosugi2007}.
 
Hinode's launch in 2007 signified a significant move forward in space based solar observations, building from what was successful in Yohkoh.
The mission introduced small wavelength increment spectroscopy to space based missions.
The EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) is designed to examine the chromosphere using two specific imaging techniques.
It is extremely flexible with 4 slit or slot positions, $1"$ pixel slit, $2"$ pixel slit, $40"$ pixel slot and $266"$ and two different modes for spectroscopy.

Possibly the most adventurous mission to probe the solar environment to date, is the STEREO mission (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory) described in \cite{Kaiser2008}.
As is suggested by the name of this mission, the primary focus was to form a more comprehensive picture of the solar atmosphere, by positioning two satellites in such an orientation to build a three dimensional picture.
Consequently, two identical satellites were launched into orbit, ahead of and behind the Earth.
There is an inherent differential in the angular velocity of the spacecraft, in order to move the spacecraft ever further around the orbit at approximately $45^\circ$ per year.
The primary objective of this stage of the mission was to obtain the optimal angle to produce three dimensional images of the Sun using a tomographic technique.

Given that STEREO was designed to give varying angles of the Sun-Earth  enviroment, the instruments on the mission are tailored to this need.
SECCHI is a suite of 5 imagers, utilising white-light coronographs, an extreme ultra violet imager and two wide angle Heliospheic Imagers (HI) designed to track CMEs to $1$ AU.
IMPACT detects solar wind electrons and in-situ solar wind magnetic field strength and vector, while PLASTIC measures composition of heavy ions, alpha particles and protons. 
Given the instumentation, STEREO is used extensively by space weather forecasters at NOAA, which will increasingly become an essential part of our lives.

Building on all of the above missions, the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) mission began in 2010 \cite{Kaiser2008}.
The instruments are developments of concepts used on previous missions but expanding them to allow constant viewing of the entire solar disk.
Consequently all instruments on SDO view the full solar disk, at all times, maintaining the same temporal cadence. 
Therefore, the SDO mission produces significantly more raw data than any previous.
From a purely engineering standpoint, the instruments were carefully selected to facilitate the downloading of the data.
As such, SDO has three instruments; the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) examining the solar variability and finer scale structure of the solar magnetic field; Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) measures the total solar irradiance in the Extreme Ultra Violet section of the spectrum and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) investigating the upper chromosphere and corona.

AIA's imaging suite provides full disk images in $4096 \times 4096$ resolution and most importantly at $12$ second cadence.
However, its distinguishing feature is the array of wavelengths analysing the atmosphere \cite{AIAspec} associated with various temperatures corresponding to the appropriate electron transitions.
The instrument ranges through $170$, $30.4$, $160$, $17.1$, $19.3$, $21.1$, $33.5$, $9.4$ and $13.1$ nm providing a temperature range of $5000$ K to $1.6 \times 10^7$ K.




\section{Plasma behaviour}

Stars are incredibly complex features despite their apparent uniformity when viewed by the naked eye.
Their behaviour is entirely unlike any planetary body, and as has already been discussed, their inherent magnetic field makes their structure extremely complex.
All of these affects can be traced back to the fact that the Sun consists of gas kept at high temperature and pressure, which causes it to form the $4^{th}$ state of matter, plasma.
Plasma is defined as a gas in which the molecules reached an energy level that cause them to eject their outermost electrons and become ions, causing the gas to be a neutral mixture of charged ions and free electrons (produced from ionising the molecules).
It can be formed in several situations on Earth, such as a discharge of current from the atmosphere to the ground, manifesting as lightning as the propagating current ionises the air.

The motion and behaviour of a plasma can be defined on small scales by 3 factors; the plasma approximation, bulk interaction and the plasma frequency.
The plasma approximation states that the particles must be close enough together that any given particle must influence all particles within the Debye screening length.
The length is dependant on the permittivity of free space, the Boltzmann constant, electron charge, temperatures of the ions and electrons, density of electrons and density of an atomic species.

\begin{equation}
	\lambda_D = \sqrt{(\epsilon_0\kappa_BT_e)/(n_eq_e^2)}
\end{equation}

Bulk interaction refers to the statement that the Debye screening length is small compared to the overall scale of the plasma, this implies that the motion of the interior guides the characteristic behaviour, rather than motion at the edges.
Lastly the plasma frequency refers to the oscillation of the elections within the plasma, which is valid in the case that the frequency is higher than the collisions between electrons and neutrals.
In this case, the electrostatic interactions dominate over the standard, gas-like behaviour we would otherwise see.
Of course, the case where all the molecules or atoms are ionised is the ideal case, however, in nature this is not always true.
The degree of the ionisation is defined in terms of the ratio of ions to electrons, $\alpha = n_i/{n_i + n_n}$ where $i$ is the number density of ions and $n$ for neutrals.

As is evident from the Debye screening length, the temperture of the plasma can have a dominating effect on the characteristics of the plasma.
The temperature is a measure of the kinetic energy of the plasma, clearly higher kinetic energy therefore equates to a higher temperature of the plasma.
However, electrons will reach a thermal equilibrium significantly faster than the ions and neutrals, in which situation the plasma will have two, or even three, populations.
In the case where the plasma's electrons and ions are in thermal equilibrium with the neutrals the plasma is said to be thermal.
In nonthermal plasmas, the electrons, whose temperatures raise quicker, will be at a higher temperature than the heavier ions and neutrals.
The degree of ionisation of the plasma that results in a thermal equilibrium is defined;

\begin{equation}
	x^2/{x - 1} = (2\pi m_e)^{3/2}/h^3 (\kappa_BT)^{5/2}/p_{gas} exp(-{\chi/\kappa_BT}), \cite{Saha1920}
\end{equation}

Where $p_{gas}$ is the gas pressure, $m_e$ is the mass of the electron and $\chi$ is the ionisation energy (energy required to remove the least bound of the electrons around an atom).
This form of the Saha ionisation equation will hold for Hydrogen, but does not take into account multiple ionisation processes, as would be the case for a more complex atom or molecule.
The result of this is that degree of ionisation in a gas will increase with increases in temperature.
It therefore follows that not all plasmas are fully ionised.
At lower temperatures, the heavier elements won't gain enough energy to ionise, sometimes despite the fact that the electrons are orders of magnitude higher in temperature.

Plasma dynamics are significantly more complicated than those of a gas, due to the presence of inherent magnetic field. 
We therefore need a set of laws to define how the plasma behaves on scales such as those applicable on the Sun and in the atmosphere.


\subsection{Magnetohydrodynamics}

Magnetohydrodynamics are the set of laws by which we describe the motion of plasma on large scales.
They were derived by \cite{Alfven1942}, an achievement for which, Alfv{\'e}n was awarded the Nobel Prize.
The rules set up are a combination of the gas pressure equations and Maxwell's laws of electrodynamics, so let us now examine this relationship.

When considering a plasma, it is important to remember that while the total charge of the plasma will be quasi-neutral, the ions and electrons which constitute the mixture still carry charge.
Consequently, motions in the plasma will cause the charges to have a change in velocity.
In accordance with Farady's law, a moving charge will cause a magnetic field to be induced and Ohms' law will also become a factor with charges moving through a magnetic field.
As such, this can be an extremely complex problem, let us begin our discussion with Maxwell's equations;

\begin{align}
	\nabla \times \mb{E} &= -\pd{\mb{B}}{t}  &\quad \textnormal{Faradys}\\
	\nabla \times \mb{B} &= \mu_0\mb{j} + \frac{1}{c^2}\pd{\mb{E}}{t} &\quad \textnormal{Amp{\`e}re}\\
	\nabla\mb{E} &= \frac{\tau}{\epsilon_0} &\quad \textnormal{Gauss'}\\
	\nabla\mb{B} &= 0 & \quad \textnormal{Gauss' law of magnetism}\\
\end{align}

where $\mb{E}$ is the electric field stength, $\mb{B}$ the magnetic field, $t$ is time, $c^2 = (\epsilon_0\mu_0)^{-1}$,$\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, $\mb{j}$ is the current density and $\tau$ is the charge density.
Faraday's law describes how a changing magnetic field would induced an electric field, hence it is also known as the Induction equation.
Amp{\`e}re's law describes the manner in which the magnetic field integrated around a closed loop, related to the electric current passing through said loop.
Gauss' law for magnetism is also known as the Solenoidal condition and states that no magnetic monopoles exist and the eponymous law describes the resulting electric field caused by an electric charge.

The second `half' of the magnetohydrodynamic equations are the laws for gas dynamics, expressed in terms of the partial derivatives:

\begin{align}
	\pd{\rho}{t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho\mb{v}) = 0 & \quad\textnormal{Equation of mass conservation}\\
	\pd{p}{t} + \mb{v}\cdot\nabla p + \gamma p\nabla\cdot\mb{v} = 0 & \quad \textnormal{Conservation of entropy}
\end{align}

in Eulerian time-dervative reference frame, evaluated for a fixed position within the fluid.
In the case of these two sets of equations, there is currently no link other than the velocity vector, $\mb{v}(\mb{r},t)$ which can be introduced through the equation of motion for a fluid element.
The equation for the motion of the fluid element is derived from the rate of change of momentum equations 

\begin{equation}
	\frac{d}{dt} \int_{V}^{}dV\rho\mb{v} = \int_{V}^{}dV\rho\td{\mb{v}}{t} = \textnormal{rate of change of momentum}
\end{equation}

In this case the rate if change of momentum will equal the net force on the fluid element, in accordance with newtons second law, therefore;

\begin{equation}
	\rho \td{\mb{v}}{f} = \rho\mb{g} + \nabla\cdot[X]
\end{equation}

where X is the total of all forces exerted on the fluid element. 
Therefore the equation which will incorporate all of these terms and calculate the acceletation on a fluid element is:

\begin{equation}
	\rho \td{\mb{v}}{t} = \mb{F} \equiv -\nabla p + \rho\mb{g} + \mb{j} \times \mb{B + \tau\mb{E}} 
\end{equation}

As we are currently assuming that we have a totally ionised fluid, therefore the electric field is defined as

\begin{equation}
	\mb{E}' \equiv \mb{E} + \mb{v} \times \mb{B} = 0
\end{equation}

and therefore, $\mb{E}'$ in a co-moving frame will vanish.
The last assumption we need to make, is that the velocity of the plasma is not relativistic $v \ll c$.

This allows us to make some assertions as to the scale of the terms in Amp{\`e}re's equation, the length scales of $l_0$ and $t_0$ are shown such that $v = l_0/t_0$.
This means we can neglect the displacement current from Amp{\`e}re's and define the current $\mb{j}$ purely in terms of $\mb{B}$:

\begin{equation}
	\mb{j} = \frac{1}{\mu_0}\nabla \times \mb{B}
\end{equation}

As a result of which, we can neglect the effects of space charge on the plasma.
Additionally, the non-relativistic assumption means that we can also make a simplification to the acceleration of a fluid element equation as the electrostatic acceleration is small, as well, Gauss' can be dropped through lack of need.
As such the electric field can expressed merely in terms of the velcoity and magneticfield vectors:

\begin{equation}
	\mb{E} = -\mb{v} \times \mb{B}
\end{equation}

But applying the above assumptions, and substituting in for $\mb{E}$ and $\mb{j}$, we obtain the basic equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).

\begin{align}
	\pd{\rho}{t} + \nabla\cdot(\rho\mb{v}) &= 0 \\
	\rho(\pd{\mb{v}}{t} + \mb{v}\cdot\nabla\mb{v}) + \nabla p - \rho\mb{g} - \frac{1}{\mu_0}(\del \times \mb{B}) \times \mb{B} &= 0\\
	\pd{p}{t} + \mb{v}\cdot\nabla p + \gamma p\nabla\cdot\mb{v} &= 0\\
	\pd{\mb{B}}{t} - \del \times (\mb{v} \times \mb{B}) &= 0\\
	\nabla\cdot\mb{B} &= 0
\end{align}

These equations are therefore applicable to the case where; 1) the plasma is strongly collisional, such that the time scale of the collision between the particles is much smaller that the characteristic time scales of the entire system.
2) The resistivity of these collisions is small \emph{i.e.} the magnetic diffusion time scale much be longer than any other process occurring within the plasma.
3) The time scale must be greater than that of the kinetic processes occuring within the plasma, such as ion gyration, Landau damping and length scales longer than the ion skin depth and Larmor radius.

By making choices with respect to the units for length, mass and time, the MHD equations can be made dimensionless.
A typical length scale can be chosen such as $l_0$ to be something sensible and $\rho_0$ and $B_0$ are chosen from a representative point in the plasma and the time unit can be inffered from a basic speed of the plasma, \emph{e.g.} the sound speed or Alf{\`e}n speed.

\begin{equation}
	v_0 \equiv v_{A,0} \equiv \frac{B_0}{\sqrt{\mu_0\rho_0}} \textnormal{which leads to} t_0 \equiv \frac{l_0}{v_0} 
\end{equation}

The density, velocity, magnetic field etc. are then used to define new dimensionless parameters and substituted back into the MHD equations, which remain unchanged but npow a have an operator for these variables instead of the variable themselves.
the crucial outcome here is that equations are not dependent on the size of the plasma evaluated, the magnetic field strength, the density or the time scale.
After scaling $l_0$, $B_0$ and $t_0$, the pressure term becomes of vital importance and is linked to the ratio between the kinetic pressure of the plasma and magnetic pressure.
This ratio is commonly referred to as the plasma beta, and is defined:

\begin{equation}
	\beta \equiv \frac{2\mu_0p_0}{B_0^2}
\end{equation} 

This is and extremely useful flag when considering the behaviour of a plasma at a less precise level, as it indicates the forces dominant in a region.
If $\beta \gg 1$ the pressure terms are dominant, meaning that the kinetic motions of the plasma will determine its overall behaviour, such as in the photosphere and below.
Whereas, in the chromosphere and upwards, the balance more favours the magnetic field and the gas movement is determined by magnetic effects.
Which leads us to another important result of ideal MHD, the frozen in condition.

We must first discuss the magnetic Reynolds number, which gives a dimensionless value to the ratio between the induction and diffusion taking place within the plasma.
It can be defined, therefore, as a ratio of the two.

\begin{equation}
	\Re_m = z\frac{VB/L}{\lambda B/L^2} = \frac{LV}{\lambda} 
\end{equation}

Where $B$ is the typical magnetic field, $V$ is the typical velocity, $L$ is the typical length and $\lambda = c^2/{4\pi\sigma}$ is the magnetic diffusivity \citep{Choudhuri1998}.
We can conclude that the Reynolds number depends significantly on the overall size of the plasma, and is therefore almost always large for astrophysical plasmas.
We can now apply this to the induction equation in the context of said large scale astrophysical plasma.
Here he will examine the ideal MHD limit, which states that the plasma will be infinitely conductive, we can therefore write;

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\mb{B}}{t} = \del \times (\mb{v} \times \mb{B})
\end{equation}

Then using the identity $\frac{\mb{Q}}{t} = \del \times (\mb{v} \times \mb{Q})$, which is applicable to the above equation and results in;

\begin{equation}
	\pd{}{t} \int_(S)^{2} \mb{B} \cdot d\mb{S}
\end{equation}

We discuss this equation in terms of the Lagrangian operator, as we wish to follow integrated surface, as applied to the plasma, as a fluid element and examine the variations in time.
We can therefore deduce that the plasma will move with the magnetic field lines, this is known as Alfv{\`e}ns theorem of flux freezing.
Take a large scale plasma such as those that originates in solar active regions, when a reconnection event occurs, magnetic fields can become detached from the solar atmosphere and be ejected into the solar wind.
The frozen in condition implies that the plasma which was on those field lines, will be carried with it.
Alternatively, in a situation where the gas pressure is dominant low in the atmosphere, a gas perturbation will cause the magnetic field to wave as well.
 


\subsection{Reconnection}
\label{sec:recon}

The above processes are considered to be ideal cases for energy emission, for example, the dissipation of MHD waves is an ideal solution to the problem, converting magnetic energy into kinetic energy.
The process is referred to as ideal, as it fulfils the conditions we highlighted above, that the plasma obeys Alfv{\`e}ns theorem of frozen in flux, and that 3 premises of effects of a kinetic scale are obeyed.
However, in the reconnection process the frozen in condition is violated, as two plasma blobs which were connected by a field line, will now no longer be.
It also, impinges on the assumption that the magnetic diffusion occurs on time scales significantly greater than the dynamic phenomena within the plasma, as reconnection takes place on much shorter time scales.
This means that the reconnection mechanism itself is non-ideal.
In such processes, the magnetic energy is converted to kinetic energy and heat, more on which later.

Reconnection was first proposed as a mechanism for magnetic X-type null points, such as those found in solar flares as demonstrated in  \cite{Giovanelli1946}.
The null point is considered to be the point at which the magnetic field vector has a resultant vector equal to zero, something which regularly occurs when two magnetic fields are interacting, for example flux emergence.
Subsequently followed up by \cite{Dungey1953} demonstrating that collapse of the magnetic field near an X-type null point would lead to the formation of a current sheet.
He also proposes the concept of breaking the magnetic field lines.
He demonstrated that small perturbations in the gas pressure near to the null point, would cause and explosive formation of the current sheet, which then enhances the plasma motions causing a feedback type effect.
A current sheet if defined as the region in which the magnetic field changes either direction or magnitude, resulting in a thin layer in which the current may be carried.
Clearly, in order for a current to be carried, the medium in which this magnetic field change occurs must be a conductor.
Fortunately, plasma is a conductor so we can carry on. 

The first MHD model to describe a reconnection event, was the Sweet-Parker model \citep{Sweet1958, Parker1957}, where the phrase, 'reconnection of field lines' was first utilised.
Although, the model was flawed, the reconnection it predicted was insufficiently quick to describe a solar flare and subsequent massive release of energy.
In the Sweet-Parker model, the current sheet that forms as a result of the interacting magnetic fields is on the global scale of the system, whereas \cite{Petschek1964}, utilised a current sheet many orders of magnitude smaller than that of Sweet-Parker.
Because of this much smaller current sheet, the reconnection rate vastly increased and was able to predict the energy generation expected in a solar flare. 
Petschek's model went on to become known as fast reconnection, with the Sweet-Parker referred to as slow.

In order for us to build a model for a reconnective event, we will need a few components, the magnetic field equations that describe the null point and a description of the current flowing over the change in magnetic field.
Let us begin our discussion with the null points, we can define the magnetic field in terms of it behaviour in X and Y by Taylor series expansion;

\begin{align}
	B_X &= bX + 2cY\\
	B_Y &= -2a + dY
\end{align}

where $a, b, c$ and $d$ are constants.
Gauss' law of magnetism, $\del \cdot \mb{B}$, implies that $d = -b$.
The magnetic field can then be defined with respect to the magnetic flux function, $\Phi$,

\begin{equation}
	B_X = \pd{\Phi}{Y'}, B_Y = \pd{\Phi}{X'}
\end{equation}  

and by applying this to the original Taylor expansion and integrating (choosing a constant of integration that allows $\Phi$ to disappear at the origin), we obtain:

\begin{equation}
	\Phi = aX^2 + bXY + cY^2
\end{equation}

We cam simplify vie the means of a rotation of the $xy$-axis, defining $X$ and $Y$ such that $X = xcos\theta - y sin\theta$ and $ Y = y sin\theta + y cos\theta$.
Substituting into the equation for the magnetic flux, and then choosing an angle for $\theta$ to remove the excess constants, $tan(2\theta) = \frac{b}{a - c}$, the $xy$ terms vanished and reveals a flux function of:

\begin{equation}
	\Phi = \frac{B_0}{2L_0}(y^2 - \bar{\alpha}^2x^2)
\end{equation}

where $L_0$ is the scale over which the magnetic field is varying and: 

\begin{align}
	\frac{B_0}{L_0} &= (a + c) - \sqrt{b^2 + (a - c)^2}\\
	\bar{\alpha}^2 &= \frac{\sqrt{b^2 + (a - c)^2} + (a +_c)}{\sqrt{b^2 + (a - c)^2} - (a +_c)}
\end{align}

Which then gives the following field components where $B_x$ vanishes on the $x$-axis and $B_y$ vanishes on the $y$-axis and field lines are the curves in the case where $Phi$ is constant:

\begin{equation}
	B_x = B_0\frac{y}{L_0}, B_y = B_0\bar{\alpha}^2\frac{x}{L_0}
\end{equation}

So, when $\bar{\alpha}^2$ is less than $0$ the magnetic flux function traces out elliptical field lines, and is sensibly named a O-type neutral point.
In the situation where $\bar{\alpha}^2 > 0$, the field lines are hyperbolic and we have an X-type neutral point, of the type applied to the solar flare problem by the authors above, with the limiting field lines being $y = \bar{\alpha}x$.
These lines go through the origin, and are known as separatrices, and form the characteristic 'X-type' null point. 
The $\bar{\alpha}$ value, which defines the angle between said separatrices, is related to the current density.
Which we can calculate by taking the curl of the magnetic field

\begin{equation}
	\mb{j} = -\frac{B_0}{\mu_0L_0}(1 - \bar{\alpha}^2)\hat{\mb{z}}
\end{equation}

Where $\hat{\mb{z}}$ points out of the $xy$ plane.
Now we have reached the point where the current density can be discussed with respect to the null point.

The current sheet typically appears at neutral points where there is a tangential discontinuity, in which case the the magnetic field is tangential and the plasma flow across the current sheet is zero.
When the system is in equilibrium, the plasma either side of the sheet, and in the sheet itself, are in pressure balance.
Usually, the total magnetic field on the current sheet will be zero, and we assume that the ambient pressures vanish, we can say that the magnetic pressure either side of the sheet is equal to the gas pressure on it:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{B_2^2}{2\mu} = p_c = \frac{B_1^2}{2\mu}
\end{equation}

Where $B_1$ and $B_2$ are the magnetic fields either side of the current sheet and $p_c$ is the gas pressure at the current sheet.
It follows that the magnetic field undergoes an exact reversal in the magnetic field.
If it is the case that the magnetic field within the sheet is parallel to the $y$ axis and varies in $x$, is defined $\mb{B} = B_y(x)\hat{\mb{y}}$, subsequently applying Amp{`e}re's law can give us the current density in $z$:

\begin{equation}
	j_z = \frac{1}{\mu}\frac{dB_y}{dx}
\end{equation}

This means that when we get a steep gradient in $B_y$ with respect to $x$, produces a strong current along the current sheet, perpendicular to the field lines.
This is the current sheet that lies at the heart of reconnection models, however the tangential discontinuity is susceptible to instabilities.
Now that we have the null point between the two magnetic fields, the current sheet that forms as a result, we have the environment necessary to begin the reconnection of magnetic field lines.

Let us consider the induction equation again defining how the magnetic field changes with respect to the magnetic field,

\begin{equation}
	\pd{\mb{B}}{t} = \del \times (\mb{v} \times \mb{B}) + \eta\del^2\mb{B}
\end{equation} 

with the first term representing the advection and the second, the diffusivity of the magnetic field.
The ratio of these two terms can be represented by the magnetic Reynolds number, $\Re_m = {den}LV/\lambda$, and of course, this value will dictate the evolution of the of the induction.
The diffusion term dominates in the case where $\Re_m \ll 1$, however me must be aware that this condition will not apply on large scales in the solar atmosphere, altough may be true on very small scales.
The magnetic field an be defined in terms of a convection equation, $\pd{B}{t} = \eta\frac{\partial^2B}{\partial x^2}$, describing the way the field diffuses away.
We are assuming a thin current sheet in this case, with the magnetic field diffusing at a rate of $\eta/l$, where $l$ is the width of the sheet amd changes with $(\eta t)^{1/2}$, increasing with time.
Whereby the magnetic field at a fixed position decreases, leading to the conclusion that it has been annihilated.

The second mechanism for the changing of the magnetic field lines is advection, under the condition $\Re_m \gg 1$, and we drop the diffusive term from the induction equation.
On these scales the frozen in condition applies, and the plasma is free to move up and down the magnetic field lines.
In this scenario we define the velocity field lines to trace out a hydrodynamic stagnation point flow.
This causes the field lines to flow inwards, and accumulate at $x = 0$ at which point the magnetic field increases significantly.
We also find that when the induction equation is considered in $y$, there is also a build up of field at $x = 0$, growing exponentially with time.

Examining the current sheet, and the accompanying increase in magnetic field stengths leads to a problem; on small scales of $X$, the diffusivity terms take over.
Therefore there must exist a balance at which the rate of plasma transporting magnetic field in, must be balanced by the rate of diffusion away from $x = 0$, producing a steady state.
Consequently, at $x = 0$ we have the two magnetic fields meeting and cancelling, and in the case where resistivity is small, the magnetic gradient will be large, causing increasing amounts of magnetic energy to be converted to kinetic.
While the magnetic field lines will disappear, the plasma which was formerly hosted on them will not, the result of this is that it will flow out of the system in $z$.

One of the first papers to demonstrate this in action at the solar surface was \cite{Innes1997}.
The authors use the SUMER instrument to examine the Si IV $139.3$ nm in two $90$ minute observing windows with rastering consisting of $5$ s exposures.
The authors capture a $4$ minute explosive event, $90$ s after the onset of the feature the doppler shifts maximise, and the events has doubled in size in the east-west direction.
They find that the asymmetries in the emission line, mirror those expected of a bidirectional the flow axis of which is away from the line of sight and the centre of the two flows is paired with the origin of the jet.
The velocity is calculated from the doppler shift, and given as $100$ km s$^{-1}$.
The apparent length of the jet $0.4$ Mm, giving a true jet length of $1.2$-$2.4$ Mm, therefore the jet stretches across the chromosphere and possibly encroached on the corona.
This length falls in the lower end for macrospicules, however its lifetime is $3$ minutes, which is a little low for a macrospicule.
