\section{The Sun}
The Sun is an extremely complex ball of plasma, th=e formation of which generated the collection of planets and asteroids we call the solar system.
As such, the study of our nearest star should be at the forefront of our research into the cosmos, any model we build to examine other stars must first accurately describe our star. 
The Sun takes its place on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram as an early life main sequence star at the yellow end of the stellar spectrum.
It is a population 3 star, meaning that it has a high metallic content, a fact which we exploit to aid in our observations.

\subsection{Structure}
The sun is approximately $6.96 \times 10^{8}$ m in diameter and has an average density of $1.4$ gcm^{-3}, approximatley $40\%$ more than the density of water and constitutes $98\%$ of the mass within our solar system.

The structure of the Sun can be divided into internal and external.
Internal structure has been inferred by the use of techniques such as seismology, therefore, we still have many questions as to the exact mechanisms dominating below the photosphere.
These examinations have revealed a stratified structure, and the centre of which is the fusion core.
Currently, the fusion process is converting $2$ Hydrogen atoms to $1$ Deuteron, positron and neutrino; this Deuteron then reacts with another proton to form ${^3}He$ and a gamma particle, and lastly two $^{3}He$ combine to form $^{4}He$ and two protons, known as the proton-proton chain. 
However as the star evolves this process will change as one fuel source runs out, the previous product becomes the new fuel.
\emph{E.g.} the next phase would convert two Helium atoms to a Beryllium atom and a gamma particle.
The particles given off in the form of gamma particles and neutrinos carry away the excess energy, and go on to form the radiative zone.
These processes require extremely high pressure and temperature in order to overcome the binding energy of the atoms taking part in the process.
The conditions needed for this fusion process are generated by gravitational pressure exerted by the rest of the star which inherently increases the temperature in accordance with the ideal gas law.

The radiative zone is appropriately named, in that, the excess energy generated in the core radiates through this section.
It has been calculated that a photon emitted in the core takes on average $100,000$ years to move through the radiative zone as a result of the random walk, a process by which a photon is emitted and absorbed repeatedly.

The tachocline is a thin layer between the radiative zone and the convection zone, of which not a great deal is known.
This is the point where p-mode oscillations, used in seismology, cease to penetrate further into the solar interior and is strongly suspected to have a crucial role in generating the solar magnetic field.
There have been recent studies which suggest that the tacholine is responsible for several $1.3$ to $3$ year cycles in feature observed higher in the solar atmosphere, however this has not been definitively proven.
It has also been proposed as the source for a dynamo generating the magnetic field.
The most important result of the tachocline is that at this point, the motion changes from uniform behaviour of the radiation zone to the differential rotation of the convective zone.
This differential rotation is the cause of much of the complexity inherent in the solar body.

% more needed here
Beyond the tachocline, radiative heat transport ceases to be as effective, and as such, convection becomes the primary form energy transport, thus, this region is named the convection zone. 
A result of this lower temperature is a transformation in the bulk motion and ao overall behaviour of the plasma.
Within the radiative zone the plasma is approximately $5$ MK and is consequently fully ionised, however with the decrease in temperature, comes a transition in the behaviour of the plasma, density drops, and the heavier elements are now not ionised.
The process by which convection takes place is cellular in nature, hot plasma rising and cool plasma falling back through the solar interior.
 


The photosphere is the layer of the Sun which we can observe with the naked eye.
The photosphere is so called, because this layer emits light in the visible spectrum, and has a temperature range of $6000$ K at the base, and $4700$ K at the top. 
From a distance, the photosphere appears to be a smooth sphere, however upon closer inspection we observe granulation, as a result of the convection zone, is ubiquitous throughout the layer.
Granulation appears as dark lines and bright 'bubbles' expanding and collapsing as hot material rises, cools and consequently falls back down into the solar interior.
These features tend to measure approximately $2$ Mm from one boundary to the other, which, are know as inter-granular lanes.
When granules bulk motion is observed , it becomes apparent that they group into larger, super-granules, where the overall motion of the granules radiates away from a central point until they fade at a point where they meet similar granules from another super-granule.
% need a granulation figure here

The most prominent feature in the photosphere are Sunspots, these are widely documented.
Observations of sunspots are dated as far back as Galileo and his first telescopes.
These features are significantly cooler that the surrounding photosphere, with a dark centre, known as the umbra, through which open magnetic field emerges from the solar interior.
Spreading away from the umbra is the penumbra, a ring of long thin structures spreading away from the umbra.
These have been widely studied and have become known as fibrils.
The reason these are so widely studied, is that it has become clear that waves travel up these features from the solar interior.
Sunspots are normally part of an extremely complex system of magnetic field, meaning that there are usually many in one active region.
It is not yet clear the exact mechanism by which sunspots are formed, however the favoured hypothesis is that of flux rope emergence.
In this model a 'rope' of magnetic field is forced up through the convection zone and the photosphere carrying plasma frozen into the magnetic field lines with them.
As a result of this formation mechanism, active regions have regions of both negative and positive polarity.
Particularly of note with sunspots, is their continual rotation.
They are observed to rotate in the opposite direction to the rotation of the Sun, while at the same time they migrate to the equator due to the magnetic configuration between the poles.


% Chromosphere
The first observations of the chromosphere were made during total solar eclipses.
When the moon entirely covered the solar disk \emph{i.e.} the photosphere, apparent at the solar limb were colourful streamers radiating from the solar centre.
The density drops sharply from the photosphere to the order of $10{-4}$ and is approximately $2$ Mm thick. 
Over this $2$ Mm layer the temperature rises from $4000$ K to $25,000$ K, this result is currently one of the primary focuses of the solar research community.
The chromosphere is incredibly complex interms of its magnetic structure and the transport of heat, consequently the chromosphere plays and essential role in the formation of explosive events such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

It is in the chromosphere where we now see the magnetic fields which are rooted in the sunspots we observe in the photosphere.
These appear as large scale loops of plasma which has been locked into the magnetic field lines, extending through this region and right into the corona, they regularly reach 10's of Mm into the atmosphere.
Lower in the chromosphere, we find a second, smaller scale population of loops, and are a few Mm across on average.
Small scale chromospheric loops have been presented as a possible link between the photosphere and the chromosphere, due the their most likely formation being a small scale flux emergence event.
% more needs to be said here

Examining any image of the chromosphere, it is almost impossible to miss the fabled 'forest of spicules'.
Spicules are small, short-lived, explosive events with origins in the chromosphere which extend through the transition region and into the corona.
They are ubiquitous in the chromosphere, their number density being of the order of $10^5$ at any given time, however, their spatial distribution is not uniform.
They are found to form on intergranular lanes, as such their is much debate about how they form.
Candidates for the formation mechanism are; magnetic reconnection, p-mode driven and 'plasma drains', although there is no conclusive evidence for any of these drives.
Spicules high number density has lead many to propose them as a possible solution to the coronal heating problem, be that through instability or propagation of waves into the atmosphere directly.
Recent in depth study has revealed the possibility of two populations of spicules, dubbed, Type-I and Type-II.
Type-I have been defined to be longer lived and less explosive, they are also observed to emerge and have a ballistic motion away from and returning to the Sun.
However, Type-II show significantly more explosive velocities, up to $150$ km/s recorded during their initial formation, however, they are not observed to return and lifetimes are not expected to exceed $5$ mins. 

Particularly noticeable in the chromosphere is the appearance of coronal holes.
These appear as regions of dark amongst the bright chromospheric features, this is a result of the cool plasma, lower in the atmosphere becoming visible through these holes.
During the minimum phase of the solar cycle, there are usually two prominent coronal holes at the solar poles. 
These can cover half of the solar disk during particularly inactive solar minima, however, at solar maxima, these polar coronal holes disappear as the magnetic field becomes increasingly complex.
The coronal holes are characterised by open magnetic field lines extending up though the solar atmosphere, whereas, in the quiet Sun (areas not coronal holes) the magnetic field lines are closed, generally forming small and large scale loops.

This magnetic field configuration of open field lines at the poles and profound non-uniformity between is a result of the differential rotation above the tachocline.
Due to faster angular velocities at the equator than at the poles, magnetic field lines which would be straight, pole to pole, are warped in accordance with the frozen in condition.
Eventually, the magnetic field between $60^\circ$ and $-60^\circ$ forms into approximate bands of alternating opposing polarity magnetic field.
The mechanism by which this structure forms, results in converging bands, \emph{i.e.} a sideways 'V' symmetrical around the equator.
This can act as a guide for other solar features, such as sunspots, pushing them towards the solar equator from either side.

A demonstration of this complex magnetic field, is the magnetic bright point.
Theses are prevelent throughout the solar atmosphere, we observe them in the photosphere and corona, however, they are very prevalent in the chromosphere.
They are thought to be regions of very high magnetic pressure, causing higher gas pressure and therefore an increase in temperature.
What would 
% not finished with the chromosphere yet 

There are several large scale features with their roots in the chromosphere.
Filaments, and their off limb counterparts prominences, are very prevalent in solar imaging.
Filaments are observed as dark strands of plasma, having risen from the cool photosphere against the hotter chromosphere, that can extend far across the solar disk and have lifetimes of many months.
Prominences are the same features observed over the limb, and hence appear as bright features against the dark sky.
This allows us to observe the impact on the atmosphere more closely. 
Upon inspection, we observe the plasma falling away from the main body of the prominence, becoming known as coronal rain.
The effect this rain has on the atmosphere is not yet fully understood, but there has be disussion as to its merits in terms of possible heating or cooling effects.

At the top of the chromosphere, temperature of the plasma increases rapidly over a very short distance, approximately $500$ km, this is known at the transition region.
It acts as a barrier, and amplifier, between chromosphere and corona with the temperature rising from $25,000$ K to $2$ MK, the mechanism which causes this is still not understood and is one of the prominent problems in solar physics.

%Corona
Above the transition region we find the corona, high temperature plasma whose behaviour is now dominated by the magnetic field which has emerged from the solar interior.
It is very rich in Iron , which, we can tell is ionised from observations, and such the temperature has a minimum value of $1 \times 10^6$ K.
The corona is a very complex system where features interact strongly with each other.
Here we observe very large scale structures here such as coronal loops and streamers, as well as transient explosive events such as Solar Flares and CME's, regularly in the same event.
Streamers are self descriptive flows of plasma moving radially away from the solar disk, they are particularly prevalent above the coronal holes and over magnetic features, such as loops, the resulting plasma from streamers then go on to contribute to the solar wind.
Coronal loops, CME's and solar flares are tightly related.
As the footpoints of the coronal loops, Sunspots, rotate and migrate towards the equator, the magnetic tension of the loop increases to the point at which a reconnection event is the only way of reducing the magnetic energy in the system.
This mechanism for the formation of solar flares is known as 
The material in the overlying loops becomes unbound as a result of the release of magnetic tension, and is released in the form of a CME, although this is not always the case.

The above model applies more to solar flares which are observed low in the corona and chromosphere, there is a seperate model in which the reconnection occurs much higher in the corona.
There is a standard model for the formation of solar flares.
The models' initial condition involves an arcade of coronal loops, with open magnetic field lines forming a streamer around the outside.
At the top of the coronal loop, a region of cool, dense plasma forms, however, remains suspended by the magnetic field.
Eventually the system will reach a non-equilibrium state and the filament will be ejected outwards from the loop system.
The resulting elongation of the magnetic field, eventually leads to the field lines, previously on opposite sides of the loop, becoming close enough that magnetic force brings them together.
This effectively severs the anchor holding the plasma filament in place, releasing it into the high corona and solar wind. 
This release of energy also has the effect of accelerating particles down the underlying coronal arcade, causing heating and brightening.
The nature of these events is sufficient to cause 'bursts' in the electromagnetic spectrum.
This is the phenomena that has been named the solar flare, which are categorised on a scale by class, B, C, M and X, with X being the highest energy (Wm$^{-2}$) and B being the lowest and 9 subdivisions within each class. 

The remaining ejected material then either falls back to the solar surface or carries on to form a coronal mass ejection.
These are very large scale features in the corona, both spatially and temporally.
They propagate through the corona, into the solar wind and beyond Earth.
They are categorised (in the LASCO database) based upon the appearance, Halo, partial halo and complete.
This is based on the difference with respect to the Earth/viewing position, a CME which is directed at Earth will appear as a halo around the Sun.
Viewed from the side, we see the fine structure of the CME, prevalent is the leading edge, at the fore of the propagating feature beneath which is a void.
The centre of the CME is generally the core, comprising of the filament that has just detached from the solar surface.
They are inherently imbued with the magnetic field that originated in the solar atmosphere.
As this magnetic field propagates through the solar wind, a shock is thought to form at the bow of the feature, these shocks may also excite heavy ions in the solar wind causing turbulence and heating.

The when the coronal materials bulk motion becomes radial, it is defined to be the solar wind.
At this point the plasmsa is dominated by the magnetic field and may be considered collisionless \emph{i.e.} he distance between the ions is greater than the mean free path.
Due to the parker spiral, the magnetic field is perpendicular to the bulk velocity of the plasma, he solar wind is not, however, uniform.
The structure is divided into two mode, fast and slow solar wind. 
The difference between the two mode was highlighted by the readinds taken by the Ulessyes mission, while in a slingshot polar orbit around Jupiter and the Sun.
The SWOOPS instument on-board, measured the velocities of ions in the solar wind and found that the distribution is non uniform.
Above the poles, the plasma reaches velocities up to $800$ kms{^[]-1]} whereas, around the quiet Sun regions we find a lower range, $300$ - $400$ kms{^[]-1]}.

With such an energetic feature extending far into the solar system, how this interacts with the planets of the utmost importance.
Planets such as Mercury and Mars with little or no magnetic field to speak of, are bombarded by the energetic particles in the solar wind.
This is also the case for the moon, with small local magnetic fields (no global dynamo) it is directly exposed.
The moon provides the best opportunity to examine such a system, we therefore observe multiple different ways the solar wind interacts with it.
% citation of that lunar paper needed here
Primary among them is proton back scattering off the lunar surface as energetic neutral atoms, roughly $8$ - $28\%$ of the particles scattered are Hydrogen.
Conversely, we also observe sputtering, however He{^++} atoms are much better sputtering agents than H{^+}, so were we to mine the lunar surface, we might find significant resources of this element. 
As such the Suns relationship with these, generally, rockier, less well 'protected' planets and solar system bodies is always going to result in direct contact between the solar surface and the surface.

The alternative is clearly planetary bodies which produce a global magnetic field.
In the case of the Earth, the magnetic field dynamo is the convecting cells of the molten magma core, whereas, in the case of the gas giants, the extremely high density causes the hydrogen to be in a metallic form and convecting cells of hydrogen are believed to be the initiator of Jupiters magnetic field.

In this case we observe and extremely complex structure and system.
The solar wind approaches with the magnetic field perpendicular to the orbital plane and the Earths' magnetic field in an approximate dipole state.
Therefore, we have a case where two vertical magnetic fields meet.
This leads to an increase in the magnetic field strength, Ion density and potential, this feature is known as the bow shock.
All the elements of the solar wind that interact with the bow shock will be affected in some way.
Ions and particles backstream off the bow shock, reflected by the potential barrier formed by the increase in magnetic field strength, and the solar wind magnetic field wraps around that of the Earth.
Behind the bow shock we find the magneto sheath, a magnetically turbulent region comprising the 
material that has managed to pass through the bow shock.
The density of particles and the magnetic pressure decreases over the magnetosheath until the pressure from this region is balanced by the Earths magnetic pressure, whereby, the magnetopause is formed.

Given that this region of the Earths magnetosphere is heavily influenced by the solar wind, the exact structure of it is defined by the state of the solar wind.
As such, the fast solar wind will compress this region further as the magnetic pressure will be higher and events such as CME's which increase the particle density, also altering this region significantly.

As the solar wind magnetic field wraps around this region, it will eventually come into contact with the open magnetic field lines at the Earths poles.
This leads to a reconnection event, releasing the magnetic tension in the open fields lines and causing them to be dragged out behind the Earth, forming the magneto tail, and eventually reconnecting with magnetic field which has made the same journey on the opposite side of the Earth. 
This forms a current sheet roughly in the equatorial plane, however, this will be impacted and changed by the solar wind and geomagnetic events in the same way as the magnetosheath.

A second result of the open magnetic field lines at the Earths poles, is that particles from the solar wind may interact with, and consequently spiral down these open magnetic field lines.
Particles spiralling down a magnetic field line are accelerating and, therefore, have excess energy which is dissipated as a electromagnetic radiation.
This manifests as the phenomenon known as the Aurora, observed at high magnitude latitudes, appearing as a ring of light when viewed from space.
Hence, when the earth is bombarded by geomagnetic storms created by flaring and CME type events, we see warping of the bowshock/magnetopause system and increased appearance of Aurora over a wider range of latitudes.

The question becomes, is the magnetospheric model we observe at Earth, applicable to the gas giants?
The answer appears to be yes, firstly, we observe Aurora on the poles of both Jupiter and Saturn, strongly implying a similar dipole magnetospheric structure with open field lines over the poles.
Differentiating the two systems is the massive size of Jupiter's magnetic field, $20,000$ times larger than that of Earths and extending 100 times further.
This significantly larger extent is, in part, due to the reduced pressure from the solar wind, allowing the magnetosphere to expand more significantly, but also attributed to the more powerful dynamo (sufficiently strong, that the Van Allen belts that are toroidal at Earth are flattened out by Jupiters magnetic field).

The Suns influence ends with the termination shock.
At this point the outward solar wind pressure is finally in balance with the pressure of the interstellar medium.
The result is that the solar wind suddenly decelerates, causing a shock to form, it has been proposed recently that voyager 2 has made it across this boundary becoming the first man made object to leave the solar system.
The region between the solar system and the inter stellar medium, draws parallels with that between the solar wind and our magnetosphere.
There is a bow shock due to the Suns progress around the galactic disk, a heliosheath and heliopause, all of which have proxies in the Sun-Earth interaction.

For all of these reasons, it is clear that the study of the Sun, its local environment and the explosive events are essential to our continued existence.
Geomagnetic storms have previously knocked out power lines and will affect the operations of satellites in orbit, consequently, predicting and understanding these explosive events is essential.

\subsection{Observations}

\subsubsection{History}
Mankind has been fascinated with the Sun for as long as we have been sentient, which is understandable given that it dictated seasons, whether crops grew and was a giant burning orb in the sky.
As such, in early civilisations it was regularly worshipped as a god, early Mesopotamian cultures worshipped Shamash, Rah was the Sun god of the Egyptians and Amaterasu is the Shinto godess.
Around these gods, mythologies were built; the Egyptian solar chariot, carryin the Sun across the sky, battling demons overnight to rise again on the other side; In Hinduism, the Sun god is named Surya and is driven across the sky in a seven horsed chariot representing the days of the week.
These mythos speak to the inherent importance of the Sun to civilisation on Earth, however it was not until the $17^{th}$ century that scientific observations really begin to occur seriously.


Fresh advancements in glass work and lens technology allowed the development of more sophisticated telescopes.
Utilising the telescope to project the image (as not to look directly at the Sun) observers hand drew their direct observations of the solar surface.
This was clearly the photosphere, due to its emissions being in the visible spectrum. 
The most prominent feature of the photosphere are the Sunspots appearing at the surface, therefore, the early telescopes allowed significant study of this feature.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{'Figs/galileo_sunspot.gif'}
	\label{fig:gali_sp}
\end{figure}

Due to the nature of the observations, Galileo and his contemporaries records do not have the Suns equator normalised to the centre. 

The work of Johannes Kepler demonstrated that the Sun rotated on its axis and Sunspots were first observed by Harriot and the Fabricus family using a camera obscura. 
Initially there was debate as to what these dark features were, one hypothesis was that these were shadows of planetary bodies inside Mercurys orbit, however Galileo demonstrated that their origin must lie on the surface.

Given the formative solar observation technology, this is where solar studies stayed for a very long time, a fact not aided by the period now termed the Maunder minimum (named for English astronomer Edward Maunder who presented this hypothesis).
This period lasted between 1675 and 1715, the sunspot count almost entirely diminished.
During this minimum, the Earths climate went in to what has become to be known as a 'Little Ice Age', where global temperatures lowered to a point where rivers, that were usually clear of ice, would freeze over to the point they could be reliably walked upon.

Study of the Sun took a large step forward when observatories such as the Royal Greenwich Observatory begun taking meaurements in 1874.
Now with consistent imaging from the same source and a history of smaller observations combined, larger patterns within Sunspots was revealed.
Primarily taking a monthly average of the sunspot count, revealed a rise and fall in the sunspot number count over an $11$ period, now referred to as the solar $11$ year cycle.
Sunspot numbers in modern times are calculated by the number of sunspot groups multiplied by $10$ as that is the average number of Sunspots in a sunspot group.
This definition is utilised by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in America and Solar Influences Data Analysis Centre in Belgium (SIDC) in Belgium.
Both of these organisations monitor the Sun and its impact on Earth including radio flux and total solar irradiance.
All of these can be used as a proxy to demonstrate the 11 year solar cycle.

If we plot the sunspots time with respect to their latitude, we produce another diagram demonstrating the 11 year cycle.
This is the now famous butterfly diagram \ref{fig:sunspot_count}, in which populations of sunspots tend to form closer and closer to the equator before a break point at which they begin forming further away, the time scale of which is 11 years.

This is a result of the preciously discussed differential rotation mechanism in action in the Suns motion.
As the magnetic field becomes increasingly complex and the band of magnetic polarity grow closer, increasingly more sunspots are pushed to the solar equator.
This demonstrates that the 11 year cycle is result of the magnetic field and dynamo.
However this is not the full picture, as a result of the ever increasing complexity of the magnetic field the poles eventually flip.
It is at this point that the butterfly diagram moves from a narrow range of latitudes to a significantly wider one, therefore, the $11$ year cycles is actually two halves of a $22$ cycle in which the magnetic field flips and then returns to it initial configuration.

\subsubsection{Spectroscopy}

Newton was the first to observe that light from the Sun could be divided into its component parts using a simple prism, but it was a very long time before we would reach a point where this information could be used for science.
1802, approximately 100 years after Newtons initial observation, William Wollaston observed the dark lines in the solar spectrum.
In a paper where he tests the limits of compound refraction when prisms are used with water, Sulphuric acid, Crystalline lens of an ox, human cuticle, beeswax (from an island where there were no bees, however when compared to beeswax, was similar) and other such everyday substances.
He let a beam of day-light enter a dark room and become incident upon a prism of flint glass.
He records that he observes two dark lines in green and blue, which, he notes 'in an imperfect experiment, might be mistaken for the boundary of these colours'.

Joseph von Fraunhofer investigated these lines even further using multiple prisms, therefore able to produce much higher refractive indices. 
He proceeded to measure and document all of the dark lines he could find, over 570, and designated the stronger lines A-K and weaker lines the rest of the alphabet.
Of course, due to the limitations of technology at the time, these lines are all in the visible spectrum and hence the wavelength range of $~300 - 900$ nm.

\begin{figure}

	\label{fig:fraunhofer}
	\caption{http://media.radiosai.org/journals/Vol_05/01JAN07/04-musings.htm}
\end{figure}


These lines are dark because they are absorption lines.
They are a result of the quantum mechanical effects of the electron energy shells around atoms and molecules.
In the case of the Sun, continuous white light spectrum is radiated from the photosphere, this light then interacts with the elements higher up in the atmosphere.
Upon incident with the atom or molecule, the exact wavelength of light which corresponds to the energy required to excite an electron from one energy level to another, is absorbed by the atom/molecule.
The direct result of this is that the wavelength absorbed in the energy transaction, is absent from the white light spectrum being emitted from the photosphere, and hence, appears as a dark line when observed from beyond the solar atmosphere. 

The field progressed and we began to fully understand the elements and electron transitions responsible for these abortion lines.
One of the most famous examples of these is the Balmer series, named for he man himself
This series is a set of 4 emission lines in the visible part of the Hydrogen spectrum, however, is specifically with respect to emission or absorption lines to and from energy level n = 2 as can be seen in \ref{fig:balmer}.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{'Figs/Balmer_series.gif'}
	\caption{http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/B/Balmer_series.html}
	\label{fig:balmer}
\end{figure}

Named after Johann Balmer, the transition from $n=3$ to $n=2$ is termed Hydrogen alpha (H$\alpha$), $n=4$ to $n=2$, Hyrdogen beta and so on for $n=5$ and $n=6$, gamma and delta respectively. 
However, while the concept of a simple 1-1 emission is clear, this does not always bear out in reality.
There can be environmental effects, such as temperature or magnetic field effecting the states of the energy level, which, can cause alteration of the wavelength of light emitted from the relaxation of the electron.
For instance, Hydrogen alpha is extremely useful for solar observation due to the high abundance of the atom in the atmosphere.
However, due to external factors influencing the energy levels, when we observe Hydrogen alpha, the deviation from the theoretical transition is sufficient to broaden the line to include both the upper photosphere and lower chromosphere.
Of course, Hydrogen does not just have transitions to the $n=2$, there are series associated with; $n=1$, Lyman, $n=3$, Paschen, Brackett details transitions to $n=4$ and Pfunf, $n=5$.

Clearly this methodology can be applied to all atoms and molecules that are in the solar atmosphere, allowing us to create a larger picture of the structure of the atmosphere.
We can do this by abundance and position, \emph{i.e.} there appears to be large amounts of a given transition line emission in this region and forming a structure by inspection.
As has already been said, we can associate certain transitions with various levels.
H$\alpha$ has already been discussed, moving up the atmosphere, He II $30.4$ \cite{Bazin2010} which is a Balmer-$\alpha$ transition, so $n=3$ to $n=2$, and has the same issue as H$\alpha$, in that it is extremely broad.
Calcium II and Silicon IV are both transition region, are utilised on-board the most recent space borne solar telescope, IRIS \citep{PereiraIRIS2014}. 
They are closely associated with the thin transition region, however, we do observe separate features not exclusively in the transition region.

Above the transition region Iron is bounteous, and so we have many emissions lines with which to examine the corona.
Fe VIII ($13.1$ nm), Fe IX ($17.1$ nm), Fe XII ($19.3$ nm), Fe XIV ($21.1$ nm), Fe XVI ($33.5$ nm) and Fe XVIII (9.4 nm) are all utilised on the spacecraft Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) with the instrument Atmospheric Imaging Assembly \cite{Schmelz2013}.
These multiple transition line from one atom are a result of the changing temperature, as it increases, the energy shells of the atoms alter, and so the various lines here apply to different temperatures.



% magnetic field recording
The energy shells of the atoms can also be effected by the environmental magnetic field, and as such we can find more out about the state of the plasma via spectroscopy as well.
The one of the effects which allows us to do this, is known as the Zeeman effect, in which, the magnetic field causes the energy levels to split based upon the spin of an electron, up or down.
The results in a splitting of what would be a single peak, into two, with the separation of the peak dependent of the size of the magnetic field present.

\end{figure}

A more suitable method by which we analyse the solar magnetic field is Stokes Polarisation Parameters.
In this method we test to what degree passing through a magnetic field has effected the electromagnetic radiation as it passes through.
In the method, the total intensity of an optical beam is defined to be a sum of three forms of polarisation, these 4 are refereed to as the polarisation parameters, I, Q, U and V.
I is raw intensity of the electromagnetic radiation, Q is the linear polarisation horizontally and vertically, U is also linearly polarized however is rotated $\pm45^\circ$ from Q and lastly V, which is polarised circularly, both left and right handed.
Using a combination of the 4 intensities it is possible to construct a vectorgram of the magnetic field and are utilised by the SDO instrument Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) to examine features on disk.
These magnetograms are ineffective at the limb, which is a limitation of the method.
This is because a feature at the limb has no background light source to use as an origin to test the result of any polarisation. 

The vector magnetograms are used widely when studying active regions, due to the very high magnetic field strength.
They can track magnetic flux cancellation which regularly leads to the formation of other features, such as solar flares and CME's, due to the release of magnetic energy into the corona \cite{Welsch2006}.

We also observe the small magnetic bright points, which we have mentioned are observed in the photosphere and chromosphere \cite{SanchesAlmeida2010}.
They are an inherent part of what is known as the magnetic network which was visible in original measurements of the solar magnetic field over the boundaries of supergranular cells.
The magnetic field emerges from the supergranule boundaries as open magnetic field lines, extending up, into the chromosphere and above \citep{Hasan2005}.
Of course, the structure there for takes roughly the same form as the photospheric observations in G-Band,  however, with bright structures highlighting the supergranular lanes \ref{fig:mag_network}.
As a result, we have open magnetic field lines emerging with a canopy of closed magnetic field between the two boundaries.
A structure such as this can be an catalyst for physical processes such as reconnection.

It is within these regions that the magnetic bright points reside.
They appear as points of extreme intensities against the cool dark plasma of the interganular lanes, due to their intense $0.1$ T magnetic field strengths.
They are demonstrated to drift and move as the granules evolve \citep{Chitta2012} which has lead the community to suggest that these point could diffuse large amounts of heat into the solar atmosphere.

\subsubsection{Coronagraphs}

Beyond $5 R_\circ$, the solar wind has become collisionless leading to minimal emissions as a result of the vastly decreased density.
Given this, we now change our approach to measure structures much further out in the corona and solar wind.
Currently, the only coronagraph still in operation is on-board the Solar Heliophysics Observatory (SoHO), the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO). 
It is a white light detector which makes use of the effect known as Thompson Scattering which allows us to observe the particles which aren't directly emitting light off limb.
The effect entails a photon colliding with a particle, and colliding with a free charged particle in a classical sense, as opposed to a quantum interaction.
As a result of this interaction, the original photon remains unchanged in terms of energy and frequency, by this method, light from the Sun is scattered off the particles in the corona and it is this light that the coronograph detects.
In order to ensure that the detector is not washed out by the light from the Sun, ans occulting disc is essential to an operational coronagraph.

The LASCO instrument has such a wide angle view that it is used to track features propagating through the solar corona, it is widely used to track space weather events.

\subsection{Technology}

In the current solar observation climate, we have a wealth of information, coming from many different sources.
Understanding the functionality of these instruments in terms of the raw method is essential to rigorous science and accurate readings.

\subsubsection{Charge Coupled Devices (CCD's)}

CCD's are essential to current observational techniques and are utilised by almost every single solar mission.
They are an evolution of early photoelectric devices, which utilised the photoelectric effect, by which, a photon is incident upon a surface and an electron.
Cumulative photons exiting more electrons eventually produce a current sufficiently large to be detected.
The were known as photomultiplier devices, the drawback of which, was the restriction to a single detection per focal plane (pixel).
The primary issue with these dectectors is that they are extemely sensitive to background radiation, some on which is a result of the thermal emission from the detector.
Due to envirnomental effects cause inherent temperature of the detector to be non uniform as such the level of background can differ significantly too.
Of course, all of these effects can be corrected for, however, this will always increase the error value on the final result.

CCD's have since taken over the role which photomultipliers occupied.
Instead, CCD's are comprised of individual detectors all of high quantum efficiency arranged in a large grid, each element of which, is a single pixel.
An individual pixel keeps an electronic record of the photons striking it (summing them to an intensity).
Each pixel behaves as a potential well, trapping electrons produced as a result of the photoelectric events with the incoming photons.
The voltage resulting from the build up of electrons, is then recorded by the 

The particular advantage to a CCD is the linear response to the incoming photons \emph{i.e.} a one to one response to the incoming photons, giving extremely accurate results.
With respect to background noise and errors, the CCD is much easier to take regular dark current measurements (taking a reading with zero light coming in) and pixel to pixel variation is accounted for using flat fielding (exposing the grid to uniform field).
The gird of pixels approach also allows for much are flexibility in analysing data and correcting for the effects of events such as cosmic rays.
This is possible due to the ability to read these recordings into a computer.

\subsubsection{Ground Based telescopes}

Solar physics spent its early development being applied in ground bases solar telescopes, as has already been discussed, particularly in centres such as Royal Greenwich Observatory and Meudon Observatory in Paris.
In the modern era, the most powerful instruments, delivering high cadence and spatial resolution, are based on the ground.
Due to the challenges of observing on the ground, the location on these facilities is carefully chosen, regularly at high altitude, minimising disturbance of the signal by the atmosphere, and away from busy, polluting cities for the same reason.
The main advantages of ground based telescopes over space bourne, is that the instruments can be heavier and literally more extensive given that they do not need to be transported into space.

On La Palma in the canary islands, at $2360$ m altitude, the Swedish Solar Telescope is situated.
It utilises a $1.0$ m mirror in a refracting, vacuum solar telescope.
The vacuum is necessary due to the quantity of light the mirror reflects, causing heating which would disrupt the signal being transmitted down to a receiver. 


\subsubsection{Space Based telescopes}

Space bourne telescopes have a significant advantage over their ground based counterparts due to the nearly constant un-interrupted, view of the Sun without the atmospheric effects disturbing the signal.
As a result, the volume of space based instrumentation as grown exponentially since the early Skylab missions taking solar images from a low Earth orbit.

The first solar mission to move on from imagers on space stations was the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO).
Placed at the gravitationally stable lagrange point, L1, between the Sun and Earth, it affords constant viewing of the Sun.
It was one of the first missions to comprehensively over the entire solar environment from dopplergrams of the photosphere, EUV imaging of the chromosphere and out to LASCO, monitoring the solar wind.

\section{Jet and Macrospicules}

The appearance of thin, explosive features with a relatively short lifespan has always been a part of solar physics.
Spicules were first observed in 1877 by a vatican observer, Angelo Secchi.
This was aided by their sheer ubiquity, they were distinctly visible at the solar limb nearly all the time.
However the larger scale, more infrequent jets are more difficult to observe, particularly with early solar observations.

\subsection{The ejecta zoo}

The wide variety of jets and jet like feature 
Jets and jet like features are observed throughout the solar atmosphere, and as such a review of the topic is in order.
As has already been discussed, spicules are the smallest jets formed in the solar atmosphere, 
most easily observed at the limb, they are long thin structure appearing brightly at the solar limb \citep{Beckers1972}.
Spicules are found in the chromosphere, regularly observed in the H$\alpha$, He II $30.4$ nm, Ca II and Si IV.
Work by \cite{DePontieu} divided spicules into two populations, Type-1 and Type-2, with Type-1 being long lived and Type-2 having distinctly shorter lifetimes, but however are significantly more explosive and grow to much higher lengths .
Type-1 spicules have an uprising speed of approximately $20$ kms$^{-1}$ and extend to $1$ Mm in height, whereas the Type-2 spicules have been shown to extend approximately $5$ Mm into the atmosphere and last for an average of $10$ minutes.
The most comprehensive difference between the two is in the overall evolution of the feature.
Type 1 spicules are observed to have a parabolic evolution \emph{i.e.} their tip traced out a ballistic arc when plotted against time.
Conversely, Type II spicules are observed to dissipate or vanish as they evolve, and are primarily observed in the quiet Sun and coronal holes, Type I develop in active regions, as such, Type II are far more numerous when recorded in a study such as \cite{Pereira2012}.

\begin{figure}

	\caption{http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/751917main_highres4_full.jpg Spicules as observed by Hinode}
\end{figure}

Spicules are visible on the disk as well, however, on disk we see dark thin structures against the bright lower chromosphere, these were initially named mottles and fibris, however have since been inherently linked with spicules, see \cite{DePointeu2007MF}.

Since these initial propositions, however, there has been doubt cast as to whether this is the case or not. 
Cite Zhang 2010 found no statistical separation of populations within spicules and recent publications but the original authors have shown that Type-2 spicules disappear from Ca II and reappear in the hotter Si IV and Mg II lines \citep{Pereira2014}.
This would imply that spicules are heating as they accelerate through the atmosphere, whether this is because the underlying formation mechanism is different or there is sufficient energy in the initialisation of the spicule to cause heating as they propagate through the atmosphere, has yet to be made clear.

The formation of spicules is still a matter of much debate given our currently limited ability to examine small scales in current observations. 
However, when observations are unable to provide explict results, numerical and analytic approaches are utilised to fill in the gaps.
\cite{DePointeu2004} outline a mechanism for the formation of spicules which originates in the photosphere.
P-mode oscillations cannot pass through the photosphere due to the minimum temperature, however, evanescence allows the waves to propogate into the higher atmosphere, where higher temperatures allow propagation to restart.
Also essential to this model is the inclination of the native magnetic field.
The authors report that the inclined field, vastly increases the likelihood of waves tunneling through the atmosphere. 
In the lower density solar atmosphere causes the photospheric velocity generated by the p-modes to leak into the atmosphere and steepen into shocks, which leave and oscillating wake in the chromosphere, the spicule.

However this is only one of many competing theories, \cite{Takeuchi2001}, demonstrate a magnetic reconnection model driving formation of spicules, whereas \cite{Martinez2011} formed a $3$ dimensional model utilising the Lorentz force to push plasma across the solar surface until it meets vertical magnetic field which forces the plasma upwards.
\cite{Hollweg1982} demonstrate a quasi-impulsive source in the photosphere is capable of generating a chain of rebound shocks in the chromosphere, causing the formation of a spicule.

A particularly pertinent model is proposed by \cite{Moore2011spic_recon}, in which magnetic reconnection is instigated by granule sized 'magnetic bubbles'.
This is applicable, as spicules are generally observed to form on the intergranular lanes.
The authors propose that Type 2 spicules are an analogue for X-ray jets (more on which later).
In this scenario, magnetic bipoles emerge from the photosphere which then interacts with the ambient field of the lower chromosphere, forming a raft of reconnection external to the bipole.
During this reconnection, the interior of the bipole remains inert while the outer most sections of the structure, 'sling shot snapping' of the magnetic reconnected field lines produce; an upward jet (Type II spicule), Alfven waves propagating up the ambient magnetic field lines and a fast MHD wave upwards across the magntic field.

The advantages of this scenario for connection is that the environment which generates these spicules, is eminently reproducible throughout the solar surface.
The scenario here is particularly convenient as it also answers questions with respect to heating of the solar atmosphere. 


In a comprehensive review of formation methods applicable to spicule like features, \cite{Sterling2000} demonstrated four formation mechanisms.

What becomes evident, after all of these models are formed, none of them generate both Type I and type II spicules, therefore it is likely that they are indeed two separate features.
