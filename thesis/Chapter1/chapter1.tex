\section{The Sun}
The Sun is an extremely complex ball of plasma, the formation of which generated the collection of planets and asteroids we call the solar system.
As such, the study of our nearest star should be at the forefront of our research into the cosmos, any model we build to examine other stars must first accurately describe our star. 
The Sun takes its place on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram as an early life main sequence star at the yellow end of the stellar spectrum.
It is a population 3 star, meaning that it has a high metallic content, a fact which we exploit to aid in our observations.

\subsection{Structure}
The sun is approximately $6.96 \times 10^{8}$ m in diameter and has an average density of $1.4$ gcm^{-3}, approximatley $40\%$ more than the density of water and constitutes $98\%$ of the mass within our solar system.

The structure of the Sun can be divided into internal and external.
Internal structure has been inferred by the use of techniques such as seismology, therefore, we still have many questions as to the exact mechanisms dominating below the photosphere.
These examinations have revealed a stratified structure, and the centre of which is the fusion core.
Currently, the fusion process is converting $2$ Hydrogen atoms to $1$ Deuteron, positron and neutrino; this Deuteron then reacts with another proton to form ${^3}He$ and a gamma particle, and lastly two $^{3}He$ combine to form $^{4}He$ and two protons, known as the proton-proton chain. 
However as the star evolves this process will change as one fuel source runs out, the previous product becomes the new fuel.
\emph{E.g.} the next phase would convert two Helium atoms to a Beryllium atom and a gamma particle.
The particles given off in the form of gamma particles and neutrinos carry away the excess energy, and go on to form the radiative zone.
These processes require extremely high pressure and temperature in order to overcome the binding energy of the atoms taking part in the process.
The conditions needed for this fusion process are generated by gravitational pressure exerted by the rest of the star which inherently increases the temperature in accordance with the ideal gas law.

The radiative zone is appropriately named, in that, the excess energy generated in the core radiates through this section.
It has been calculated that a photon emitted in the core takes on average $100,000$ years to move through the radiative zone as a result of the random walk, a process by which a photon is emitted and absorbed repeatedly.

Photosphere
The photosphere is so called because this layer emits light in the visible spectrum and equates to what we can see when we look at the sun with the naked eye.
From a distance, the photosphere appears to be a smooth sphere, however upon closer inspect we observe granulation completely covers the surface.

The most prominent feature in the photosphere are Sunspots, these are widely documented.
Observations of sunspots are dated as far back as Galileo and his first telescopes.
