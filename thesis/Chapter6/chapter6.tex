\chapter{Conclusions}

Macrospicules are an intriguing feature of the solar atmosphere.
The work that is presented in this thesis has attempted to shed some light on these prevalent parts of the atmosphere.
\cref{ch:3} can be easily compared to the previous works on a like-for-like basis.
The previous examples of measurements, given by \cite{Bohlin1975} and \cite{Dere89}, are compared in \cref{table:final_properties}.
The values found here compare particularly well with Bohlin, however, the work by Dere finds more conservative values.
Given the improved nature of instrumentation and measuring tools utilised in this work, we assert that the values found here should become the new expected measurements defining a macrospicule.

This study also found no divergence in the population of features measured.
This might be expected in the case where some of the macrospicules are the cool component of a hotter feature.
Of course, the possibility remains that, they are part of a larger scale feature and the properties are similar to those of regular macrospicules, but there is no evidence to support this hypothesis within this study.   

With respect to the ballistics and enegetic of the feature, we find the unexpected effect of a macrospicule becoming thinner post apex of its motion.
Another theory could be that the magnetic pressure would cause the width to increase, however the evidence does not agree with this, as such we need to think about the macrospicule not just as a column of regular plasma.
The likely case is that the plasma begins to flow down the magnetic field lines, in a similar manner to evanescence, resulting in a decrease in the width of the feature.

\cref{ch:5} is the culmination of this thesis and is the most comprehensive view of a macrospicule in this work.
The most significant result of which, is a demonstrated very clearly in the line of sight dopplergrams.
The macrospicule feature clearly shows a rotation initially in the anti-clockwise direction, before slowing in rate, stopping and then rotating clockwise.
It is also apparent that the feature 'unwinds' from the tip of he macrospicule downwards before developing across the entire feature.  
This unequivocally proves that macrospicules have an intrinsic magnetic field.
This is interesting, as it has implications on the formation mechanism.
If it were the case that these were merely an expulsion of plasma from a reconnection method highlighed in \cref{sec:recon}, a more complex process is underway.

Fortunately, the resolution of SST allows us to examine the footpoint of the macrospicule.
The conclusion that arises from this is that the macrospicule seems to undergo a formation event similar to Shibata's standard jet formation model.
The brightenings evident in the H$\alpha$, show too much smaller brightpoints evolving and joining before the spire eventually forms.
The extension of this feature in the lower temperature emission lines, where it extends the furthest, is roughly $12$ Mm, not large for a macrospicule.
And so, the fact that this small scale jet features a very similar formation profile to larger coronal jets.
The implications for classification are that the waters are now muddied.
Should macrospicules be classed as standard jets?
Given that this feature is very thin, but the first work shows average widths of ~$7$ Mm, do we also get 'blowout' style macrospicules?

 
\subsection{The future}

Macrospicules and their relationship (or lack thereof) with jets, will continue to be essential to our understanding of the solar atmosphere, given that they originate in the low chromosphere and extend up into the corona.
The questions of the most importance at the moment are of their structure and formation mechanism.
Both of these may be answered by the new DKIST telescope.
The leap forward that DKIST will take with respect to spatial and temporal resolution will allow us to examine the footpoints of these features with significantly greater accuracy.
Possibly more intriguing is the body of macrospicules themselves.
Given the 'unwinding' of magnetic twist observed in \cref{ch:5}, it may be possible to inspect individual strands of flux rope, which could answer:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Are the macrospicules unwinding in all cases?}
	\item{Could the twisting motion be a result of a driver from below?}
	\item{Do the macrospicules always have a tortional or helical component?}
	\item{Can macrospicules be considered as a major factor with respect to heating or solar wind acceleration?}
\end{itemize}
 
 
Those are just the questions considering macrospicules on their own.
Macrospicules current place in the plethora of jet-like solar featuers is still far from clear, despite this work.
Are macrospicules instances of multiple spicules `superposing' and becoming a much larger feature as supposed by \cite{Xia2005}?
Are they the cool component of X-ray jets? In which case should we merely be calling them X-ray jets observed in chromospheric emission lines?
There has been much work on the subject of H$\alpha$ and He II $30.4$ nm macrospicules but we have yet to conclusively prove that these features are one and the same.  
 
 
 
Hopefully our suite of solar observational instruments and the ever improving state of data analysis will lead us to answer these questions in the future.
