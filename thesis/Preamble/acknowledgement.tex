I would like to thank all teachers, lecturers and supervisors who have supported me throughout my education.
The faculty of SoMaS have been immensely supportive throughout all problems and successes that have come my way.
Most importantly I would like to thank Robertus for his support.
He has pushed me to become the very best scientist I could be, and I cannot thank him enough.

I am an immensely annoying person to live with, so I would like to thank Nabil Freij for putting up with my slovenliness for three and a half years.
Stuart Mumford, for the Python lessons, particularly during first year, and Drew Leonard for being a rubber duck on all too regular a basis.
Thank you to Stevie Chaffin, Alex Hague, Freddie Mather, Chris Nelson and all the solar physics PhD's in the office of doom, for mutual stress in the difficult times and elation in the good. 
I would also like to thank everyone at the University of Sheffield Cycle Club, there are too many to mention by name, you were an excellent outlet when I needed one.

I would like to thank my family, Sue, Steve and Kathryn for their confidence in me, infinite patience when and for keeping me grounded.
