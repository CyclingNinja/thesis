\begin{acknowledgements}      

I would like to thank my family, Sue, Steve and Kathryn for their confidence in me, infinite patience when and for keeping me grounded.
Kimberley, thank you for you non-stop belief in me.
I also need to thank all the teachers, lecturers and assistants from high school to University (twice), who have imparted to me their knowledge, wealth of experience and enthusiasm for Physics, and without whom I would not have been able to achieve so much.

I am an immensely annoying person to live with, so I would like to thank Nabil Freij for putting up with my slovenliness for three and a half years.
Stuart Mumford, for the Python lessons, particularly during first year, and Drew Leonard for being a rubber duck on all too regular a basis.
Thank you to Stevie Chaffin, Alex Hague, Freddie Mather, Chris Nelson and all the solar physics PhD's in the office of doom, for mutual stress in the difficult times and elation in the good. 
I would also like to thank everyone at the University of Sheffield Cycle Club (UoSCC!), there are too many to mention by name, you were an excellent outlet when I needed one.
