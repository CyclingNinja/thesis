Given recent advancements in observational solar physics, both in quality and quantity, the time is right to revise the chromospheric feature, macrospicules.
These jet-like phenomena are larger than their namesake spicules, which only extend to $10$ Mm as an absolute maximum and are ubiquitous in the solar chromosphere, particularly the intergranular lanes.
However, neither are they as large as the so-called coronal jets or the X-ray jets, generally observed in hotter temperature lines and penetrating much higher into the solar atmosphere.
The aim of this work is to better classify macrospicules as a populations and to detect any possible relationships on a global scale.

This is achieved first by means of a statistical sample of macrospicules.
We utilise the first two and a half years of AIA/SDO's operation window and collect macrospicules data throughout.
This two and a half year sample acts as a proxy for the ramp from solar minima in mid $2010$ to maxima in late $2012$.
Over this time period we find an general increasing trend for the properties of the macrospicules.
A range of charcteristic features of the macrospicules, such as: maximum length and width, maximum velocity and lifetime are stated and compared to the current literature.
This same sample is then tested against the Carrington longitude to test for any relation to what has been termed, an active longitude.
In this case, we find that the macrospicules do have a correlation to the so-called active longitude.

Lastly, this work presents a detailed case study of macrospicules, utilising a wide range of available imagers.
The case study involves a jet-like feature that is seen at the solar limb in CRISP/SST, AIA/SDO and EUVI/STEREO.
Applying a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method we analyse the spectroscopic data from CRISP and build a profile of the line of sight velocities of the jet.
Lastly, we attempt to determine whether or not the jets have an effect on the atmosphere above it.
